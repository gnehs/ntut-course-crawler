In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed. Through the internalization, the students might benefit themse\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5b50\u4e00\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=94&sem=1&code=853", "code": "853"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u694a\u7407\u60e0", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=22117", "code": "22117"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["5", "6"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559306(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=94&sem=1&code=31", "code": "31"}], "people": "56", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "85506", "code": "1404005", "name": {"zh": "\u61b2\u6cd5\u8207\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e", "en": "Constitutional Principles"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71\u5148\u751f\u5275\u7acb\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4e4b\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e\u5728\u65bc\u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9\u4e4b\u81ea\u7531\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6c11\u4e3b\u3001\u5747\u5bcc\uff0c\u6b64\u7cbe\u795e\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4f9d\u64da\u7684\u539f\u5247\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u61b2\u6cd5\u70ba\u7d93\uff0c\u3000\u570b\u7236\u5efa\u570b\u4e4b\u7406\u60f3\u6b65\u9a5f\u70ba\u7def\uff0c\u4ffe\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5145\u5206\u77ad\u89e3\u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u4e26\u8a8d\u8b58\u6211\u570b\u61b2\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u5167\u6db5\uff0c\u57f9\u990a\u5b78\u751f\u7dad\u8b77\u61b2\u6cd5\u4e4b\u5c0a\u56b4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u611b\u570b\u5bb6\u611b\u6c11\u65cf\u4e4b\u60c5\u64cd\u3002\n", "en": "The Republic of China is established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the basis of Equality, Democracy, and Equated Distribution of Wealth, which are also the principles in San-Ming-Zhu-Yi (literally, Three Principles of the People).

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.
