You will select a research topic and compose two short (3-7 page) papers and one full length (8-10 pages for linquistics track students; 10-12 pages for literary track students; except for those students working with me, in which case the minimum requirement is 16-20 pages in length) research essay based on both primary and secondary sources.  You will begin your research, in all likelihood, by looking at secondary sources; by the middle of the semester, however, you must have located\u2014and physically shown to me\u2014at least two primary textual sources.  Today, the first day of class, you will select a general topic for further research.\r\nGive some care to selecting a workable topic.  It will work best if you have a genuine desire to learn more about your chosen area.  It will also be easier to write about your topic if it is somewhat open-ended\u2014that is, allowing for something more than just a recitation of facts.  To find a topic that will work for you, begin by selecting a broad area of interest.  Some general areas that I would recommend for your consideration include literature, art, film, philosophy, psychology, music and cultural studies.  But you may select any broad area that you are willing to devote your scholarly efforts to over the next four months.  During that time, you will progressively narrow your more overarching topic down so that finally you will be focusing on specific key works (that is, primary sources) to develop an original, complex thesis idea that sheds new light on your topic and the scholarship available upon it.  All of the shorter papers and informal journal writing assignments should be looked at as possible versions of portions of your final paper; and indeed your final paper may, if you so desire, be looked at as a possible version of a portion of your senior project.\r\n", "schedule": "February 12\tIntroduction/ ASSIGNMENT:  Library Field Trip:  Choosing a Book\r\nFeb 19\t\tDiscussion of Research Topics I\r\nFeb 26\t\tDiscussion of Research Topics II  ASSIGNMENT: JE#1\r\nMarch 5\tShare Journal Entries I\r\nMarch 12\tShare Journal Entries II / ASSIGNMENT: JE#2\r\nMarch 19\tShare Journal Entries I\r\nMar 26\t\tShare Journal Entries II/ ASSIGNMENT WA#1\r\nApril 2\tWA#1 Due/ Peer Evaluation I\r\nApril 9\tPeer Evaluation II/ ASSIGNMENT:  JE#3\r\nApril 16\t\tWA#1 DUE/Share JE#3 I\r\nApril 23\t\tShare JE#3 II/ ASSIGNMENT JE#4\r\nApril 30\t\tShare JE#4 I\r\nMay 7\t\tShare JE# 4/Group Presentations\r\nMay 14\t\tGroup Presentations  ASSIGNMENT:  Compose Final Project\r\nMay 21\t\tDRAFT (WITH THREE EXTRA COPIES) OF FINAL PAPER DUE\r\nJune 4\t\tPEER EVALUATION\r\nJune 11\t\tFINAL PAPER DUE\r\n", "scorePolicy": "GRADING\r\n25%\tPapers 1-3\t\t\t\t\r\n25%\tQuizzes and Journals\r\n25%\tFinal Paper\t\t\t\t\r\n25%\tParticipation and Presentation\r\n", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
