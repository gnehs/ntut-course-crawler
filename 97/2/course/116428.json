Logic and language are inseparable. Students who have chosen language studies as a profession are obligated to think logically, and to argue analytically in the use of the language acquired. This course, however, is not intended to introduce theories of argumentation; nor does it seek to produce theoreticians of philosophy. It is, in his nature, a practical preparation for students who are about to engage in myriads of academic and professional tasks, which demand strong ability in critical reasoning and logic-based argumentation. The learning of the English language is also enhanced through the studies of the materials.\r\nCourse Objectives:  This course has its dual emphases and aims to help the students establish strong critical thinking and argumentation skills as well as learn the use the English language logically. Students will be able to\r\n(1)\tunderstand the basic principles of logic and the language   of logic\r\n(2)\tunderstand the framework of argumentation\r\n(3)\tidentify the principal forms of illogical thinking\r\n(4)\tthink, reason and argue analytically and critically\r\n(5)\tacquire and use key terms in simulated case debate\r\n", "schedule": "Week/ Date\tContent Unit / Chapter\r\n1_ Feb. 18\tOrientation / What is critical thinking and how to improve it?\r\n2_ Feb. 25\tIdentifying reasons and conclusions: the language of reasoning\r\n3_ Mar. 4\tUnderstanding reasoning: different patterns of reasoning\r\n4_ Mar. 11\tUnderstanding reasoning: assumptions, context and a thinking map\r\n5_ Mar. 18\tEvaluating inferences: deductive validity and other grounds\r\n6_ Mar. 25\tEvaluating inferences: assumptions and other relevant arguments\r\n7_ Apr. 1\tReasoning about causal explanations\r\n8_ Apr. 8\tMidterm\r\n9_ Apr. 15\tWhat are the reasons? /What words and phrases are ambiguous?\r\n10_ Apr. 22\tWhat are the value conflicts and assumptions? / What are the descriptive assumptions?\r\n11_ Apr. 29\tAre there any fallacies in the reasoning? / Identifying flaws in the argument\r\n12_ May 6\tEvidence / How good is the evidence? / Finding and evaluating sources of evidence\r\n13_ May13\tRelevance: probative relevance, dialectical relevance, relevance in meetings and debates\r\n14_ May 20\tRelevance: relevance in legal argumentation, fear appeal arguments, etc\r\n15_ May 27\tThe use and abuse of logic 1\r\n16_ Jun. 3\tThe use and abuse of logic 2\r\n17_ Jun. 10\tThe use and abuse of logic 3\r\n18_ Jun. 17\tFinal Exam\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Course requirements:\r\nEach student must fulfill the following requirements:\r\n(1)\tStudy each chapter / unit assigned prior to class session.\r\n(2)\tSubmit an elaborated outline of the chapter assigned for each week.
