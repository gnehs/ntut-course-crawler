We will focus in particular on the relation between writing and argument, looking closely at the structure of introductory paragraphs and thinking about the kinds of questions that are the basis of written arguments.  In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the issue of aesthetics (the study of ideas about beauty and about art).   Our topics will include:  favorite artists; ingenious inventions; art and film; storytelling and personal creativity; self-discovery.  \r\n\r\n", "schedule": "1\tWhat is an Argument?\r\n\r\n2\tReview:  chapter 1 readings \r\nArguments and Problems  (making clear the consequences of a problem)\r\nonscreen student paragraphs \r\n\t\tDue:  description of a painting\r\n\r\n3\tProblems: Conceptual vs Pragmatic  (Chapter 3)\r\n\tDiscuss student paragraphs\r\n\r\n4\tReview chapter 3 part 1 (Tangible and Conceptual Problems) \r\n+ Discuss part 2 (The Structure of Problems)\r\n\tDiscuss List of Questions (about your painting)\r\n\tDiscuss question form\r\n\t\tDue:  revision + list of questions\r\n\r\n5\tFairy Tales and Problem Structure\r\n\tDiscuss Students List of Questions\r\n\r\n6\tReview:  Fairy Tale Structure\r\n\t\tDue:  Fairy Tale\r\n\r\n7\tOn screen paragraphs:  Fairy Tales \r\n\r\n8\tStyle Chapter 1\r\nGrammar:  sample student sentences\r\n\t\r\n9\tStyle Chapter 2\r\nGrammar:  sample student sentences\r\n\t\tDue:  revision of Fairy Tale\r\n\r\n10\tStyle Chapter 3\r\n\t\tMIDTERM DUE\r\n\r\n11\tConceptual Problems vs Pragmatic Problems:  student samples in course book\r\n\r\n12\tConceptual problems:  Stable Context\r\n\t\t\tDue:  revision of midterm\r\n\r\n13\tDiscuss paragraphs on Museums\r\n\t\tDue:  Why we hang paintings in a museum\r\n\r\n14\tQuestions about painting:  developing an intro\r\n\r\n15\tFilm:  Pygmalion\r\n\t\tDue:  painting \u2013 conceptual intro\r\n\r\n16\tDiscuss conceptual intro paragraphs\r\n\tSuggestions for next year (senior projects)\r\n\r\n17\tFINAL EXAM due\r\n \r\n", "scorePolicy": "Grades:\r\n\tWriting Assignments / Class work 33.3%\r\nMidterm project  33.3%\r\n\tFinal project  33.3%\r\n\r\n", "materials": "Books:\r\n\tCourse reader\r\n\r\n\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n \r\n", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
