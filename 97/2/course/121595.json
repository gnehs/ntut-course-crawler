Project I involves a writing of analysis on educational or social issues.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments. Project II\u2014Reading the News\u2014emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.", "schedule": "2/20\tEnumeration\t  \r\n         The Old Days\r\n2/27\tAnalysis\t           \r\n         Typical Science Fiction Film\r\n3/6\tCritical Thinking\t  \r\n         College is a Waste of Time and Money\r\n3/13\tCollege is a Waste of Time and Money\r\n3/20\tArgument--evidence\t\r\n         School as a Spin Control\r\n3/27\tArgument--logic\t  \r\n         Romance is a Poor Basis for Marriage\r\n4/3\tArgument--use of analogy\t\r\n4/10\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n4/17\tProject I finished\r\n4/24\tComparison and Contrast\t\r\n         Two Colonial Attitudes toward Marriage\r\n5/1\tBrowsing through the news--\tWhat\u2019s the Story\r\n         NYT\u2014Now Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China\r\n5/8\tSelecting a news event\t\r\n         The Noose Incident\r\n5/15\tComparing and Contrasting Media (Re)Presentations\t\r\n5/22\tArguing Your Point of View\t\r\n         An Appropriate Expression?\r\n5/29\tArguing vs. Expressing Your Opinion\t\r\n         Ithacan Inquirer \r\n6/5\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n6/12\tProject II finished\r\n6/19\tReview and Discussion\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Criteria for grading\r\n1.\tProject I: 35% (draft 1\u201410%; draft 2\u201410%; final draft: 15%)\r\n2.\tProject II: 35% (draft 1\u201410%; draft 2\u201410%; final draft: 15%)\r\n3.\tAssignments and In-class Practices: 30%\r\n", "materials": "Pamela Gay.
