It provides theoretical and experimental insights to examine the phenomenon of language development from multi-disciplinary perspectives.\r\nCourse Objectives:  This course aims to help the students\r\n(1) understand the principles and processes governing L1 & L2\r\nacquisition and learning\r\n(2) examine how non-native language ability develops\r\n(3) become familiar with SLA theories to account for many facets of non-native discourse\r\n", "schedule": "Weekly Syllabus\r\nWeek \tText Chapter\r\n1_Feb.20\tOrientation + Ch. 1 Key Issues in Second Language Acquisition\r\n2_Feb.27\tCh. 1 Key Issues in Second Language Acquisition\r\n3_Mar.6\tCh. 2 The role of the first language\r\n4_Mar.13\tCh. 2 The role of the first language\r\n5_Mar.20\tCh. 3 Interlanguage and the natural route of development\r\n6_Mar.27\tCh.3 Interlanguage and the natural route of development\r\n7_Apr. 3\tCh. 3 Interlanguage and the natural route of development / Ch. 4 Variability in interlanguage\r\n8_Apr.10 (Class rescheduled to __________)\tCh. 4 Variability in interlanguage\r\n9_Apr.17\tMidterm\r\n10_Apr.24\tCh. 5 Individual learner differences and Second Language Acquisition\r\n11_May 1\tCh. 5 Individual learner differences and Second Language Acquisition\r\n12_May 8\tCh. 7 Learner strategies\r\n13_May15\tCh. 7 Learner strategies\r\n14_May 22\tCh. 9 The role of formal instruction in Second Language Acquisition\r\n15_May 29\tCh. 9 The role of formal instruction in Second Language Acquisition\r\n16_Jun.5\tCh. 10 Theories of Second Language Acquisition\r\n17_Jun.12\tCh. 10 Theories of Second Language Acquisition\r\n18_Jun.19\tFinal Exam\r\n*Class schedule is subject to necessary modifications at the professor\u2019s discretion.\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Course Requirements:\r\n(1)\tAll students are required to use a copyrighted textbook. No photocopied edition will be accepted for use in class. It is important for students to be aware that legal action will potentially be sought by the publisher in the case of using an unauthorized duplicated text.\r\n(2)\tSubmit a pr\u00e9cis of the chapter section assigned to students and give a brief presentation. (sample provided) Students are divided into four groups. Each group will be responsible for providing a pr\u00e9cis of two chapters assigned respectively. Pr\u00e9cis needs to be submitted to the instructor and distributed to the class prior to / on the date when the content chapter content is scheduled to be introduced.\r\n(3)\tStudents pair up for Q & A sessions in class. The failure to respond to questions will result in a 5% grade reduction in the component of participation. A 5% of semester grade will be granted for a successful response. Student respondents will be chosen randomly.\r\n(4)\tEach student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.\r\n(5)\tThe instructor will not assign additional readings. However, as SLA is multi-disciplinary in nature, it comprises a broad array of theories and studies. Students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings. In order to earn extra credits, students are obligated to submit a short critique of the recommended reading text.\r\n(6)\tAttendance: Students are required to attend the class as scheduled.\r\ni.\tEach unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction.\r\nii.\tAt the sole discretion of the instructor, some absence penalties may be waived with valid proof and just cause. No Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. Students forfeit the right of contention after that. It is important to know that only ONE- time penalty waiver will be granted to any student.\r\niii.\tLateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Two times of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.\r\nEvaluation Procedures & Grading System:\r\nFinal grades will be determined by a point system (X out of 100 total points). Students will be evaluated by the following components.\r\n(1)\tSummary & Presentation + Class Participation 20%\r\n(2)\tMidterm 25%\r\n(3)\tFinal 25%\r\n(4)\tAttendance 30%\r\n", "materials": "Required Texts:   Ellis, Rod.
