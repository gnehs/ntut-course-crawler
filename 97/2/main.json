With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

It would be our honor to have them in the campus and share their fruition of art with all of the staff and students.\n"}, "stage": "4", "credit": "1.0", "hours": "1", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=2&code=1062", "code": "1062"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u9673\u5733\u537f", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=11334", "code": "11334"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["A"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u56db\u6559204(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=75", "code": "75"}], "people": "37", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u591c\u9593\u6f14\u8b1b\u8ab2\u7a0b"}, {"id": "116814", "code": "8401003", "name": {"zh": "\u7e6a\u756b", "en": "Painting"}, "description": {"zh": "\u7406\u8ad6\uff1a\r\n1.\u7d20\u63cf\u6982\u5ff5\r\n2.\u5f62\u9ad4\u8207\u7a7a\u9593\u8868\u9054\r\n3.\u98a8\u683c\u4ecb\u7d39\r\n\u6280\u6cd5\uff1a\r\n1.\u5617\u8a66\u591a\u5143\u5a92\u9ad4\u8868\u73fe\r\n2.\u7df4\u7fd2\u5fc3\u7dd2\u8868\u9054\r\n3.\u7269\u9ad4\u6479\u5beb\r\n\u5275\u4f5c\u8207\u9451\u8cde\uff1a\r\n1.\u7d20\u63cf\u7684\u98a8\u683c\u8207\u8868\u9054\r\n2.\u7d20\u63cf\u5275\u4f5c\r\n\u53c3\u8a2a\u8207\u89c0\u6469\n", "en": "Theories\uff1a\r\n1.Concepts of sketch\r\n2.Expressions of structure and space\r\n3.Introduction of styles\r\nTechniques\uff1a\r\n1.Try expressing of multiple\r\n2.Practice expressing from the state of mind\r\n3.Sketch some objects\r\nCreation and Appreciation\uff1a\r\n1.Styles and expressions of sketch\r\n2.Sketch creation\r\nVisit to art museum\n"}, "stage": "4", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=2&code=1062", "code": "1062"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8881\u91d1\u5854", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=22232", "code": "22232"}, {"name": "\u66fe\u5df1\u8b70", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=22496", "code": "22496"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["7", "8", "9"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u8a2d\u8a08508", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=349", "code": "349"}, {"name": "\u56db\u6559204(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=75", "code": "75"}], "people": "38", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u6c34\u5f69  \u52062\u7d44\u4e0a\u8ab2,\u4e00\u7d44\u56db\u6559204,\u4e00\u7d44\u8a2d\u8a08\u9928508"}, {"id": "116815", "code": "8401004", "name": {"zh": "\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u8a0e", "en": "Senior Project(II)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u900f\u904e\u8a2d\u8a08\u5c08\u984c\u7684\u6f14\u7df4\uff0c\u767c\u5c55\u5b78\u751f\u6574\u9ad4\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5275\u65b0\u8a2d\u8a08\u5c08\u696d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4ee5\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u7a76\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u5b78\u751f\u500b\u5225\u8208\u8da3\u5c08\u9577\u9078\u5b9a\u5c08\u984c\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u6f14\u7df4\u65b0\u7522\u54c1\u958b\u767c\u4e4b\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u57f9\u990a\u5de5\u696d\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e4b\u5c08\u696d\u3002\n", "en": "This course aims to a thesis project within the practices areas of industrial design, chosen by the student in consultation with the program instructors.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

When art is used to express feelings, advocate religions, propagandizing politics, or transmitting thoughts, it never needs any reason. Don't say that you don't know what art is! In the 21st century, art is no longer the privilege of wealthy ladies. But you all, the future designers and architects, should work harder to make yourself inseparable with art. When you are sharing your own experience about esthetics, exploring different art sects, analyzing art styles, engaging in cultural creative design, or criticizing the contemporary art sects, you have the right to speak up. \r\nThe ten speeches in this series will be delivered by many experts from different fields. It would be our honor to have them in the campus and share their fruition of art with all of the staff and students.\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "1.0", "hours": "1", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=2&code=1164", "code": "1164"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u5433\u53ef\u4e45", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=11393", "code": "11393"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["A"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u56db\u6559203(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=74", "code": "74"}], "people": "40", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u591c\u9593\u6f14\u8b1b\u8ab2\u7a0b"}, {"id": "120961", "code": "1400022", "name": {"zh": "\u82f1\u6587", "en": "English"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u8a2d\u8a08\u91cd\u9ede\u6709\u4e09\uff1a(1)\u85c9\u7531\u7cbe\u9078\u7684\u4e2d\u7d1a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6559\u6750\u52a0\u5f37\u5b78\u751f\u5fc5\u5099\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u6587\u6cd5\u89c0\u5ff5\u548c\u53e5\u578b\u7d50\u69cb\uff1b(2)\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u78ba\u5207\u628a\u63e1\u95b1\u8b80\u8981\u9818\u4ee5\u53ca\u5145\u5206\u77ad\u89e3\u5beb\u4f5c\u7684\u5404\u7a2e\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u91cd\u5fc3\u5728\u751f\u5b57\u3001\u7247\u8a9e\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\u91cb\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u5beb\u4f5c\u6280\u5de7\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff1b(3)\u900f\u904e\u7df4\u7fd2\u52a0\u5f37\u807d\u3001\u8aaa\u3001\u8b80\u3001\u5beb\u7684\u77e5\u80fd\u53ca\u8868\u9054\u3002\n", "en": "This course is designed (1) to strengthen students' previously required knowledge in English with basic grammatical ideas and sentence patterns reviewed through selected materials at intermediate level; (2) to get the most (gist) out of the reading and appreciate the writing strategy of diverse interests.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically.

As Han people brought in agriculture from mainland China, songs, poetry, and theater had closely related to sacrificial rites. In modern history, the development of recording history was driven by urbanization and industrialization.

Through the study on the shape, the incised decoration and the function of the jade, we can understand the primitive religion and the ritual life in the Three Dynasties, as well as the witchcrafts practiced since Eastern Chou. As an art form, the jade is a concrete object, but in effect it embodies the spiritual life of people, enriching and reflecting the metaphysical aspects of culture, which serves as a starting point for exploring aesthetic concepts. This course aims to integrate authropological and cultural aesthetic perspectives. With the assistance of the recently unearthed jade, the emphasis is put on ancient people's idea of jade and their usage of it. It is hoped to guide students to conceptualize the spiritual life of ancient people and further realize that objects are the things which motivate our creativity, inspire our imagination.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u901a\u8b58\u8ab2\u7a0b(\u56db)", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=2&code=576", "code": "576"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8449\u60e0\u862d", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=10375", "code": "10375"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["3", "4"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559201(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=2&code=19", "code": "19"}], "people": "11", "peopleWithdraw": "4", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "121842", "code": "1410109", "name": {"zh": "\u5510\u5b8b\u5143\u4fd7\u6587\u5b78", "en": "Tang dynasty, Song dynasty & Yuan dynasty's folk literature"}, "description": {"zh": "\u6240\u8b02\u300c\u4fd7\u6587\u5b78\u300d\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u901a\u4fd7\u7684\u6587\u5b78\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u6c11\u9593\u7684\u6587\u5b78\uff0c\u5728\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u570b\u6587\u8ab2\u7a0b\u591a\u504f\u91cd\u65bc\u58eb\u5927\u592b\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u300c\u96c5\u6587\u5b78\u300d\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9019\u4e00\u70ba\u591a\u6578\u4eba\u6c11\u6240\u559c\u597d\u7684\u5927\u773e\u6587\u5b78\uff0c\u9019\u662f\u76f8\u7576\u53ef\u60dc\u7684\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7279\u5225\u5c31\u4fd7\u6587\u5b78\u7684\u7bc4\u7587\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5510\u4ee3\u8b8a\u6587\u3001\u5b8b\u4ee3\u8a71\u672c\u53ca\u5143\u4eba\u96dc\u5287\u4e09\u500b\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u4ecb\u7d39\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9078\u64c7\u9019\u4e09\u500b\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u5b83\u5011\u4e0d\u50c5\u6d41\u884c\u65bc\u7576\u4ee3\u6c11\u9593\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5f8c\u4ee3\u767d\u8a71\u5c0f\u8aaa\u53ca\u6232\u5287\u7684\u6e90\u982d\uff1b\u900f\u904e\u9019\u4e9b\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u4e0d\u50c5\u80fd\u77ad\u89e3\u8a72\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u77ad\u89e3\u4fd7\u6587\u5b78\u548c\u96c5\u6587\u5b78\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u95dc\u4fc2\uff0c\u9019\u5728\u6587\u5316\u3001\u6b77\u53f2\u53ca\u6587\u5b78\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u7fa9\u7684\u3002\n", "en": "Folk literature is well-known and popular among people.

The teacher will take students to visit many different female enterprises and have an on-site inspection for different types of female entrepreneurs.

Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers. For these important reasons, this course aims to guide students to appreciate Shakespeare by focusing on a number of his plays.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType":
