In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of sport and culture, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  stories from film and books; non-fiction accounts of famous athletes and sporting events; narratives of our own personal accomplishments (athletic and otherwise).  \r\n\r\n", "schedule": "Week 1\t9/8\tIntro\r\nWeek 2\t9/15\tChildhood Hero (\u201cWho I wanted to be\u201d)\r\nWeek 3\t9/22\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 4\t9/29\tno class [typhoon]\r\nWeek 5\t10/6\tFormative Memory\r\nWeek 6\t10/13\t\tcontinued \t\r\nWeek 7\t10/20\tReports on baseball and culture\t\t\t\t\r\nWeek 8\t10.27\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 9\t11/3\tMIDTERM\r\nWeek 10\t11/10\tGroup story\t\r\nWeek 11\t11/17\tInterview:  famous athlete\r\nWeek 12\t11/24\t\tcontinued\t\r\nWeek 13\t12/1\tNews report:  \u201csports\u201d in the news  on the non-sports pages\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (politics, business, history, science)\r\nWeek 14\t12/8  \t\t continued\r\nWeek 15\t12/15\t 20 Questions\t\r\nWeek 16\t12/22\tFilm:   Eight Men Out\r\nWeek 17\t12/29\tfilm discussion\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Grades:\r\n\tMidterm  \t33.3%\r\n\tFinal  \t\t33.3%\r\n\tParticipation  \t33.3%\r\n\r\nGrading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n \r\n", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
