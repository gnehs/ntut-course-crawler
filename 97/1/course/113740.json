The essay registers Dickens's anti-slavery sentiment.\u201cSlavery in Massachusetts\u201dis an essay based on a speech Henry David Thoreau gave at an anti-slavery rally at Framingham, Massachusetts, on July 4, 1854. Published in the August 19, 1843 edition of The Saturday Evening Post,\u201cThe Black Cat\u201dis a short story with psychological depth.
