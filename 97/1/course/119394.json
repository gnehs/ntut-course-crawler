Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others\u2019 speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 3-4 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(*1)\r\nCourse Requirements: \tStudents\u2019 responsibilities in this class include:\r\n(1)\tAttending class regularly and to arrive on time: a sign-in sheet to record attendance / a grade reduction of 5% of the semester grade for each class session missed absence\r\n(2)\tAll presentations assigned\r\n(3)\tDelivering speeches as scheduled:\r\ni.\tStudents are required to present their speeches on the day scheduled;\r\nii.\tMake-up speech will be allowed only when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence at the instructor\u2019s discretion.\r\niii.\tThe ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) will create a 10-point deduction. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\r\n(4)\tSubmitting to the instructor a speaker\u2019s dossier with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as its full-length version, the self-evaluating commentary of previous presentation(s) and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks (see Appendix 1) when presenting the speech. Failure to submit will generate a penalty of 20 points (out of 100) in each speech. Students who fail to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below) will forfeit the opportunity to deliver the current speech / debate.\r\n(5)\tDistributing the current speech outline(s) to fellow students at the beginning of each class session\r\n(6)\tEvaluating one\u2019s own speech: all speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and later submit a self-evaluating commentary to the instructor a week after the speech presentation. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete portfolio needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\r\n(7)\tOffering constructive opinions and feedbacks of the fellow students as speakers: Students are encouraged to give verbal / oral commentary of the fellow students\u2019 speeches, and with the objectively constructed criticism, the student evaluators will earn 3% grade points to their semester grades.\r\n", "schedule": "Public Speaking and Debate_ Weekly Schedule, Fall 2008\r\nWeek_ Date\tSession Task \tSession Administrator(s)\tNote\r\n1_0908\tOrientation \tDr. Yang\r\n2_0915\tGeneral Public Speaking Guidelines\tDr. Yang\r\n3_0922\tIntroductory Speech \tDr. Yang & Students \tImpromptu (2-3 mins)\r\n4_0929\tGuidelines for Informative / Persuasive Speech\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n5_1006\tDelivery of Informative Speeches (1)\tDr. Yang & Students\tExtemporaneous (3-4 mins)\r\n6_1013\tDelivery of Informative Speeches (2)\tDr. Yang & Students\tExtemporaneous (3-4 mins)\r\n7_1020\tDelivery of Persuasive Speeches_ General Human Interest (1)\tDr. Yang & Students\tMemorized\r\n(4-5 mins)\r\n8_1027\tDelivery of Persuasive Speeches_ General Human Interest (2)\tDr. Yang & Students\tMemorized\r\n(4-5 mins)\r\n9_1103\tDelivery of Analytical Speech_ Social / Public Concerns (1)\tDr. Yang & Students\tMemorized\r\n(4-5 mins)\r\n10_1110\tDelivery of Analytical Speeches_ Social / Public Concerns (2)\tDr. Yang & Students\tMemorized\r\n(4-5 mins)\r\n11_1117\tGuidelines for Debate\tDr. Yang\r\n12_1124\tPreparing for Debate (Standard)\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n13_1201\tDebate 1-1 (Standard)  \tDr. Yang & Students\r\n14_1208\tDebate 1-2 (Standard)\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n15_1215\tPreparing for Debate (Cross-Ex.) \tDr. Yang & Students\r\n16_1222\tDebate 2-1 (Cross-Ex.)\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n17_1229\tDebate 2-2 (Cross-Ex.)\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n18_0105\tFinal Debate Match (Lincoln-Douglas)\tDr. Yang & Students\r\n*The above weekly schedule is subject to necessary modifications as the class proceeds.\r\nSpeech Topics: Choose ONE for the following topics\r\n(A)\tIntroductory Speech Topics\r\n1.\tWill I ever go from rags to riches?\r\n2.\tThings That Trouble Me Most in My College Life\r\n3.\tHow Misery Loves Company: My Story\r\n4.\tEvery Cloud Has a Silver Lining: My Story\r\n5.\tHow many baskets do you have to hold all your eggs?
