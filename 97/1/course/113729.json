Beautiful or not, alternative forms of art have become increasingly influential in shaping our culture and our daily lives, from television, to pop music, to advertising, to online games.\r\nStudying films, television and other forms of pop culture, we will consider the nature and significance of pop culture in the West and in the East.  Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or \u201chigh\u201d culture?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture \u2013 can what is popular be good; must what is popular be good?\r\n", "schedule": "Popular Culture\t\tT 1-4\r\n\r\nWeek 1\t9/9 \tIntro: \tWhat is popular culture?  \r\nWeek 2\t9/16  \tKill Bill Vol. 2\r\nWeek 3\t9/23\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 4\t9/30\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 5\t10/7\tStar Wars IV\r\nWeek 6\t10/14\tStar Wars V \r\nWeek 7\t10/21\tStar Wars VI\r\nWeek 8\t10/28\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 9\t11/4\tMIDTERM\r\nWeek 10\t11/11\tGhost World\r\nWeek 11\t11/18\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 12\t11/25\t\tcontinued\r\nWeek 13\t12/2\tStudent presentations\r\nWeek 14\t12/9\tStudent presentations\r\nWeek 15\t12/16\tStudent presentations\t\t\r\nWeek 16\t12/23\tStudent presentations\r\nWeek 17\t12/30   Student presentations\r\n\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Grades:\r\nMidterm  33%\r\nFinal\t33%\r\nShort Assignments and Class Presentations/ Participation  33%\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n", "materials": "Books:\r\nCourse reader", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
