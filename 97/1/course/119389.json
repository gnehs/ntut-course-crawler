Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.\r\nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult\u2019s My Sister\u2019s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students\u2019 vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.\r\n", "schedule": "9/12\tIntroduction/ Misconceptions about Writing\r\n9/19\tFinding the Topic /\u201cGary Larson\u2019s Cartoon\u201d/My Sister\u2019s  Keeper(pp. 1-21)\r\n9/26/\tObserving\tReading a Painting/ M: 22-43\r\n10/3\tFree Association/\u201cProspect Park\u201d/M: 44-68\r\n10/10\tHoliday\r\n10/17\tFinding the Central Idea/\u201cThe Match\u201d/M: 69-101\r\n10/24\tMoving toward  Significance/\u201cDaddy Tucked\u2026\u201d/M: 102-117\r\n10/31\tDialogue with a Text /M: 118-139\r\n11/7\tReview and Discussion /M: 140-196\r\n11/14\tSummary/\u201cStory of an Hour\u201d/M: 197--264\r\n11/21\tParaphrase & Reader\u2019s Response/\u201cThe Ticket\u201d/M: 265-326\r\n11/28\tCharacter Analysis\t/\u201cCat in the Rain\u201d/M: 327-389\r\n12/5\tWriting an Analysis /M:390-423\r\n12/12\tDeveloping an Argument/\u201cNecklace\u201d/M:425-500\r\n12/19\tExplaining the Significance of the Support\r\n12/26\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n1/2\t\u201cSong: Love Armed\u201d\r\n1/9\tReview and Discussion\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Criteria for Grading\r\n1.Project I--35% (1st draft: 10% +2nd draft: 10% +final\r\ndraft: 15%\r\n2.Project II\u201440% (reading portfolio: 10%+ 1st draft: 10%\r\n+ revised draft: 20%)\r\n3.Attendance, In class practice, Peer-reviewing and comments,\r\nAssignments: 25%\r\n", "materials": "Textbooks:\r\n1.
