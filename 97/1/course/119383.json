In the course of practicing such skills, we will explore the concept of conversation as story-telling, in particular a mutual exchange of stories.  Our topics will include: stories from film and other forms of popular culture;  stories and their genres (romance, science fiction, horror, adventure);  descriptive accounts of paintings and objects;  non-fiction accounts of historical people and events;  narratives of our own personal history and invention.\r\n\r\n", "schedule": "Freshman Conversation         W 1-3\r\n\r\nWeek 1\t9/10\tIntro:  summer vacation\r\nWeek 2\t9/17\tPersonal Narrative:  A Story of Anger, Jealousy, or Fear\r\nWeek 3\t9/24\t\tcontinued\t\r\nWeek 4\t10/1\t Super powers:  If I could . . .
