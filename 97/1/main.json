In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u96fb\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=1&code=1059", "code": "1059"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u694a\u7407\u60e0", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=1&code=11249", "code": "11249"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["7", "8"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559306(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=1&code=47", "code": "47"}], "people": "41", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "113909", "code": "1404004", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u53f2", "en": "The History of China"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ee5\u6b77\u53f2\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u95e1\u8ff0\u53ca\u5c08\u984c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u85c9\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u8a8d\u8b58\u6642\u4ee3\u4e4b\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u6388\u8ab2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u8b1b\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u8a0e\u8ad6\u53ca\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u8f14\uff0c\u671f\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\uff0c\u80fd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u6709\u4e00\u7c21\u8981\u800c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u3002\n", "en": "Methodologically, the course is performed in two ways at the same time: interpretation of historical trends as well as the study and analysis of specific topics.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill. As a response to this concern, a new discipline, engineering ethics, is emerging for undergraduate engineering courses. This discipline will doubtless take its place alongside such well-established fields as medical ethics, business ethics, and legal ethics.

From putting continually the improved camera, video cassette recorder, copying machine, etc., to market can just account for how important a designing tool the Geometric-Optics is.To build a solid basic theory and a rule for calculating through understanding thoroughly the nature of light is the central goal of Optics. Using the basic theory of optics and processes of approximate estimate, the Geometric-Optics put its point on image formation and its applications.Here in our department, the Geometric-Optics is a 3-credit, 3-hour per week, one-semester course. There are three consecutives parts in the one-semester lecture:The 1st part : (a)the nature of light, (b)the related theorems about reflection and refraction, (c) image formation.The 2nd part : the formation and correctness of aberrations.The 3rd part : the designing of lenses.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u96fb\u8cc7\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=97&sem=1&code=1060", "code": "1060"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u5f90\u5dcd\u5cf0", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=1&code=11013", "code": "11013"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["3", "4"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["3"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u5149\u83ef\u9928104", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=97&sem=1&code=442", "code": "442"}], "people": "8", "peopleWithdraw": "1", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u661f\u671f\u4e94\u5728\u5149\u83ef\u9928108\u6559\u5ba4\u4e0a\u8ab2"}, {"id": "119154", "code": "1102004", "name": {"zh": "\u8ecd\u8a13(\u4e09)", "en": "Military Training(III)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5927\u4e8c\u4e0a\u5b78\u671f\u70ba\u8ecd\u8a13\uff08\u4e09\uff09\u5169\u5b78\u5206\u9078\u4fee\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u5217\u4e09\u55ae\u5143\u4e2d\u9078\u64c7\u5169\u8005\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u4e86\u89e3\u6211\u570b\u56fa\u6709\u5175\u5b78\u601d\u60f3\u3001\u6230\u722d\u539f\u7406\u3001\u539f\u5247\u53ca\u6230\u722d\u6307\u5c0e\u85dd\u8853\uff0c\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u5175\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u589e\u9032\u8ecd\u4e8b\u4fee\u990a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u6c11\u570b\u9632\u5171\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u7dad\u8b77\u570b\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u6b66\u5668\u53ca\u6b66\u5668\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u76ee\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u570b\u6240\u767c\u5c55\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u5f0f\u6b66\u5668\u80fd\u4f5c\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u6211\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\u6210\u5c31\u6709\u6240\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u555f\u767c\u9752\u5e74\u5b78\u751f\u53c3\u8207\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u8b77\u7406\u8207\u5065\u5eb7\uff0d\uff0d\u6982\u8ff0\u540c\u5927\u4e00\u5973\u751f\u90e8\u4efd\u3002\r\n\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u6b66\u5668\u53ca\u6b66\u5668\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u76ee\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u570b\u6240\u767c\u5c55\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u5f0f\u6b66\u5668\u80fd\u4f5c\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u6211\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\u6210\u5c31\u6709\u6240\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u555f\u767c\u9752\u5e74\u5b78\u751f\u53c3\u8207\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\r\n\u8b77\u7406\u8207\u5065\u5eb7\uff0d\uff0d\u6982\u8ff0\u540c\u5927\u4e00\u5973\u751f\u90e8\u4efd\u3002\n", "en": "Military Training includes three Courses at the first semester of second year.

Songs are a rhythmic form of language. They record and reflect human histories before written symbols are invented. The history of songs can therefore best show specific historical changes. In early years of Taiwan aboriginal society, songs were used to entertain both gods and people and had social functions. As Han people brought in agriculture from mainland China, songs, poetry, and theater had closely related to sacrificial rites.

Because of time limited, the subject of this course will only introduce general conception of microeconomics and its analytic methods, such as supply-demand law, theories of consummer and producer behavior, type of markets... and so on.
