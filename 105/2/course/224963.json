In this course, after a brief background in the first week or two, we will spend our time on four novels. Jane Eyre, Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (and perhaps its sequel Through the Looking-Glass), Huckleberry Finn, and 1984, are books that people in Britain or the U.S. would be nearly as likely to pick up for fun as they would be to read them in class. They\u2019re also books that almost everyone knows something about\u2014even if individuals haven\u2019t read the book. Knowing these books and the context they came out of will give you the ability to understand many ideas that are central to British and American identity and culture. \r\n\r\nThrough informal investigations and in-class activities, you will learn the literary and historical context of the novel in each era. How has fiction changed over time? How did the purpose of writing change? How have tastes changed? And why are these changes important?", "schedule": "The first week will be devoted to setting up the course, but many of you are already quite well-prepared because you have just taken the survey on British and American literature. After this, we will spend several weeks reading Jane Eyre; one hour of our class time each week will be spent reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland aloud and discussing it. \r\n\r\nLater in the course we will read Huckleberry Finn, and we will end with 1984. \r\n\r\nThere is no midterm exam, but there is a final.", "scorePolicy": "In-class Writing and Reading Quizzes: 30%\r\nClose Readings: 30%\r\nFinal: 25%\r\nIn-class Activities and Participation: 15%", "materials": "Jane Eyre (Charlotte Bront\u00eb)\r\nAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Lewis Carroll)\r\nHuckleberry Finn (Mark Twain)\r\n1984 (George Orwell)\r\n\r\nSupplemental material on e-learning", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
