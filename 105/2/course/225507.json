Linear Equations \r\n- To understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\r\n- Solving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form. \r\n- To interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\r\n- First exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation. \r\n2. Matrix Algebra \r\n- To learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\r\n- To summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns. \r\n3. Vector Spaces \r\n- Introduction to vector spaces. \r\n- Fundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\r\n- Basis and dimension of a vector space. \r\n4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\r\n- To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. \r\n- Diagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\r\n5. Orthogonality and Orthogonal Bases \r\n- To introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\r\n- To be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\r\n- Least-squares approximation.", "scorePolicy": "1.
