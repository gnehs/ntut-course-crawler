Students will be asked to respond to model texts in a manner in some way redolent of the original source\u2014usually some key masterpiece from world literature.  Student responses may explore  imaginatively constructed experiences in writing as suggested by the source text, or may adapt the formal considerations of the source text, which themselves can never be fully disentangled from content.  There is no role in this class for Wikipedia or other such garbage-heaps of watered-down descriptions and puerile analyses.  Everything you must write down, except for a few approved secondary source texts under special occassions, must derive from either the original source text or follow as a development of the student\u2019s own writing practice as it encounters this course of study as well as the works of fellow classmates. Class will often be conducted in a workshop manner, and students will be expected to share their works with their classmates on a regular basis.", "schedule": "COURSE SCHEDULE\r\n\r\nAll assignments are due next class session unless otherwise indicated.
