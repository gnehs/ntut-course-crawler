Intermediate Chinese is designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. While all four skills are emphasized, primary attention will be given to listening and speaking, since a solid foundation in these two skills is vital to the development of reading and writing skills. Upon completion of the course, you should be able to speak Chinese with some fluency on everyday topics and be able to write short compositions on simple everyday life topics. We not only educate you to compare Chinese culture with your own culture, but also immerse you in a Chinese cultural environment and provide you with the communicative tools you need in order to act appropriately in Chinese culture.", "schedule": "W1\tIntroduction \u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ecb\u7d39\r\nW2\tLesson 2 Visiting a Night Market \u7b2c\u4e8c\u8ab2 \u901b\u591c\u5e02\r\nW3\tLesson 2 Visiting a Night Market \u7b2c\u4e8c\u8ab2 \u901b\u591c\u5e02\r\nW4\tLesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand \u7b2c\u4e09\u8ab2 \u9084\u662f\u5c0f\u5403\u597d\r\nW5\tLesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand \u7b2c\u4e09\u8ab2 \u9084\u662f\u5c0f\u5403\u597d\r\nW6\tLesson 4 Tea and Chinese People \u7b2c\u56db\u8ab2 \u8336\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\r\nW7\tLesson 4 Tea and Chinese People \u7b2c\u56db\u8ab2 \u8336\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\r\nW8\tMidterm \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8a66\r\nW9\tLesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers \u7b2c\u4e94\u8ab2 \u6211\u611b\u7d05\u5a18\r\nW10\tLesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers \u7b2c\u4e94\u8ab2 \u6211\u611b\u7d05\u5a18\r\nW11\tLesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! \u7b2c\u516d\u8ab2 \u53f0\u5317\u600e\u9ebc\u90a3\u9ebc\u64e0\r\nW12\tLesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! \u7b2c\u516d\u8ab2 \u53f0\u5317\u600e\u9ebc\u90a3\u9ebc\u64e0\r\nW13\tLesson 7 Roasted Students \u7b2c\u4e03\u8ab2 \u71b1\u934b\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u70e4\u300d\u751f\r\nW14\tLesson 7 Roasted Students \u7b2c\u4e03\u8ab2 \u71b1\u934b\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u70e4\u300d\u751f\r\nW15\tLesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs \u7b2c\u516b\u8ab2 \u5927\u62dc\u62dc\r\nW16\tLesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs \u7b2c\u516b\u8ab2 \u5927\u62dc\u62dc\r\nW17\tFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a\r\nW18\tFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a", "scorePolicy": "Attendance and class performance \u51fa\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8207\u8ab2\u5802\u8868\u73fe\t30%\r\nHomework and quizzes \u4f5c\u696d\u8207\u5c0f\u8003\t20%\r\nMidterm Examination \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8a66\t20%\r\nFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a\t30%\r\nTotal \u5408\u8a08\t100%", "materials": "\u4eca\u65e5\u53f0\u7063\uff1a\u4e2d\u7d1a\u6f22\u8a9e\u8ab2\u7a0b Taiwan Today: An Intermediate Course, 2004 Extended Edition (note: make sure to get this edition.
