The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) constitutes a failure w/o points awarded. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\r\n(3)\tSubmitting to the instructor a speaker\u2019s dossier with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as its full-length version, the speech evaluation card, the self-evaluating commentary of previous speech(s) and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks (see Appendix 1 & 2) when presenting the speech. Students who fail to submit the dossier as scheduled and also to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below) forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.  \r\n(4)\tStudent speakers are also required to display their outline slide(s) during the speech. \r\n(5)\tEvaluating one\u2019s own speech: all speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and compile all speech and debate evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete electronic portfolio (on compact disc) needs to be established and submitted at the semester end. \r\n(6)\tSelf-evaluation: Students are required to evaluate him/herself after delivering an in-class speech. Self-evaluation is to be submitted along with other materials in the dossier.    \r\nGrading Policy: \t(1) Academic honesty is prioritized in this class. Students should learn that plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students will fail the course without contention once an incident of plagiarism is identified in their submitted writing or presented speech.  \r\n(2) No speech scripts allowed. The grading components are as follows:\r\n\t\r\nComponent\tGrade Percentage \r\nAttendance *2)\t20% (full attendance) (*2)\r\nIntroductory Speech \r\n(Business topics: new business models, innovations, and inspirational stories) \t10% \r\nPersuasive Speech (A)\r\n(Selling new ideas, lobbying for changes/ reforms)\t10% (extemporaneous: 3 index cards allowed) \r\nPersuasive Speech (B)\r\n(Settling controversial issues, clarifying political and social myths)\t10%                              \r\nDebate Speech \r\n(Affirmative & Negative Rebuttal Speech) \t10% \r\nGroup Debate 1 (Standard format) \r\nGeneral Interest Topic \t15% (team performance grade 40% + individual debater performance 60%) \r\nGroup Debate 2 (Cross-Examination format) \r\nPolicy Debate\t15% (team performance grade 40% + individual debater performance 60%)\r\nFinal Debate Match (Lincoln-Douglas format / impromptu)*4\t10% (TBD) \r\nSpeech Assessment Portfolio (Speech outlines, scripts audios, commentary notes and peer evaluation entries) \tRequired (*5)", "materials": "Notes: \r\n*1) Student speakers need to videotape their speeches each time and submit the digital recordings at the end of the semester. \r\n* 2) Students are obligated to attend all class sessions. Each absence will generate 10% point deduction of the semester grades on the 100% scale. \r\n*3) All extemporaneous speeches allow speakers to deliver the speech with its outline and necessary visual aids, such as flash cards, posters and PPT slides. Student speakers who use a script at speech delivery will result in the total loss of the component grade. (For each speech, students shall keep the comments/grades (on speech card) for the purpose of monitoring their performance and the final result.) \r\n*4) The implementation of the final debate match is likely to be subject to certain contingent occurrences as the class proceeds. Exact date, format and related matters will have to be discussed and determined later in the semester. \r\n* 5) Students are required to submit the speech assessment portfolio at the end of the semester. Failure to submit the portfolio will override the grades received in other grading components and thus results in a failing grade.\r\n(Course content and activities are to be adjusted for effective teaching and learning. The above syllabus is thus subject to modification as the class proceeds. Updated info will be provided when necessary.) \r\nSpecial Note: Students are given permission to devise his/her own syllabus. More details will be discussed in class at the orientation session.", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
