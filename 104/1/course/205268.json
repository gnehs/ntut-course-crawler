Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or \u201chigh\u201d culture normally studied in schools?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Should we value pop culture works in the same way as classic works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture:   Can what is popular be good? Must what is popular be good?", "schedule": "\u3000", "scorePolicy": "Grades:\r\n\tMidterm  50%\r\n\tFinal\t50%\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 4 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
