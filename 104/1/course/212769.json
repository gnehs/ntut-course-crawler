Intermediate Chinese is designed to consolidate the foundations built in Basic Chinese and continue developing students' skills in aural comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing. While all four skills are emphasized, primary attention will be given to listening and speaking, since a solid foundation in these two skills is vital to the development of reading and writing skills. Upon completion of the course, you should be able to speak Chinese with some fluency on everyday topics and be able to write short compositions on simple everyday life topics. We not only educate you to compare Chinese culture with your own culture, but also immerse you in a Chinese cultural environment and provide you with the communicative tools you need in order to act appropriately in Chinese culture. \r\n\r\nClass Procedures and Expectations \u4e0a\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u8981\u6c42\r\nLearning a foreign language is like learning to play a musical instrument or training for a sport. They all require commitment and practice. Therefore, preparation before class, as well as punctual attendance and active participation in class is the key to your success in this class. According to our grading system, unexcused absences, coming to class late or without preparations will inevitably result in a lower final grade. \r\n\r\nNo make-up quizzes will be given for unexcused absences. However, one lowest score from your quizzes will be dropped. Students with excused absences (see Policies) need to make up the quizzes within a reasonable time frame. If you have to miss midterm exam due to family or medical emergencies, you should inform Liao laoshi immediately and make up the test as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nFor group presentation, you should collaborate nicely to come up a good presentation together.\r\n\r\nPolicies \u898f\u5b9a\r\nAbsences \u4e0a\u8ab2\u7f3a\u5e2d\r\nFormal request for excused absences in writing is required. Even if you do not have a good reason for an absence, it would be nice if you could let Liao laoshi know why you had to miss a class. \r\n\r\n3-3 Rule: If you are absent for classes for three times or more (including both excused and unexcused absences), your final grade will be automatically lowered by one grade (e.g. an \"A\" will be lowered to \"A-\" and so on) for every three absences you have. Three tardiness to class will count as one absence.", "schedule": "W1\t9/16\tIntroduction \u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ecb\u7d39\r\nW2\t9/23\tLesson 2 Visiting a Night Market \u7b2c\u4e8c\u8ab2 \u901b\u591c\u5e02\r\nW3\t9/30\tLesson 2 Visiting a Night Market \u7b2c\u4e8c\u8ab2 \u901b\u591c\u5e02\r\nW4\t10/7\tLesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand \u7b2c\u4e09\u8ab2 \u9084\u662f\u5c0f\u5403\u597d\r\nW5\t10/14\tLesson 3 Eating at a Food Stand \u7b2c\u4e09\u8ab2 \u9084\u662f\u5c0f\u5403\u597d\r\nW6\t10/21\tLesson 4 Tea and Chinese People \u7b2c\u56db\u8ab2 \u8336\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\r\nW7\t10/28\tLesson 4 Tea and Chinese People \u7b2c\u56db\u8ab2 \u8336\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u4eba\r\nW8\t11/4\tMidterm \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8a66\r\nW9\t11/11\tLesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers \u7b2c\u4e94\u8ab2 \u6211\u611b\u7d05\u5a18\r\nW10\t11/18\tLesson 5 Marriage and Match-Makers \u7b2c\u4e94\u8ab2 \u6211\u611b\u7d05\u5a18\r\nW11\t11/25\tLesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! \u7b2c\u516d\u8ab2 \u53f0\u5317\u600e\u9ebc\u90a3\u9ebc\u64e0\r\nW12\t12/2\tLesson 6 Taipei is so crowded! \u7b2c\u516d\u8ab2 \u53f0\u5317\u600e\u9ebc\u90a3\u9ebc\u64e0\r\nW13\t12/9\tLesson 7 Roasted Students \u7b2c\u4e03\u8ab2 \u71b1\u934b\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u70e4\u300d\u751f\r\nW14\t12/16\tLesson 7 Roasted Students \u7b2c\u4e03\u8ab2 \u71b1\u934b\u4e0a\u7684\u300c\u70e4\u300d\u751f\r\nW15\t12/23\tLesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs \u7b2c\u516b\u8ab2 \u5927\u62dc\u62dc\r\nW16\t12/30\tLesson 8 Religions and Folk Beliefs \u7b2c\u516b\u8ab2 \u5927\u62dc\u62dc\r\nW17\t1/6\tFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a\r\nW18\t1/13\tFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a", "scorePolicy": "Attendance and class performance \u51fa\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8207\u8ab2\u5802\u8868\u73fe\t30%\r\nHomework and quizzes \u4f5c\u696d\u8207\u5c0f\u8003\t20%\r\nMidterm Examination \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\u8a66\t20%\r\nFinal Presentation \u671f\u672b\u5831\u544a\t30%\r\nTotal \u5408\u8a08\t100%", "materials": "\u4eca\u65e5\u53f0\u7063\uff1a\u4e2d\u7d1a\u6f22\u8a9e\u8ab2\u7a0b Taiwan Today: An Intermediate Course, 2004 Extended Edition (note: make sure to get this edition.
