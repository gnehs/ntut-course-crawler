The purpose of this course is to learn the concepts and physical principles of water flow as well as the techniques that can be used to solve hydrologic problems. Thus, one of the goals of this course is to give you a balanced view of hydrology - one that includes a description of the physical processes plus a coherent presentation of the theories and techniques that are used in practice.", "schedule": "1.\tHydrological cycle.\r\n2.\tFrequency analysis.\r\n3.\tPrecipitation.\r\n4.\tLosses from precipitation.\r\n5.\tHydrograph.\r\n6.\tFlood routing.\r\n7.\tGroundwater.\r\n8.\tHydrological measurement.", "scorePolicy": "25% quizs, 25% midterm exam, 30% final exam, 10% Homework, 10% class participation.", "materials": "Midterm and final exam(s), tests, and homework.
