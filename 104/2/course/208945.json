Topics covered will include the probability axioms, basic combinatorics, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, mathematical expectation, common families of probability distributions, the central limit theorem, inferential statistics, and some useful statistical methods. The course objectives are to enable students having the ability to\r\n1. Summarize and present data; \r\n2. Describe probability distributions and compute probabilities; \r\n3. Conduct point and interval estimation; \r\n4. Make inference about populations; \r\n5. Apply these concepts in practice with emphasis on engineering applications, engineering design, decision making and management sciences.", "schedule": "1\tEstimation \r\n2\tEstimation \r\n3\tEstimation \r\n4\tTest of Statistical Hypotheses \r\n5\tTest of Statistical Hypotheses \r\n6\tTest of Statistical Hypotheses \r\n7\tNonparametric Methods \r\n8\tHomework Assignments Review and Recapitulation \r\n9\tMidterm Exam\r\n10\tReview of Midterm Exam\r\n11\tNonparametric Methods \r\n12\tNonparametric Methods \r\n13\tBayesian Methods \r\n14\tBayesian Methods \r\n15\tStatistical Theory\r\n16\tStatistical Theory & Homework Assignments Review \r\n17\tFinal Exam", "scorePolicy": "Grading Policy: 30% Homework Assignments & Quizzes, 30% Midterm, 30% Final, 10% Participation", "materials": "[Textbook]\r\n\r\nRobert V.
