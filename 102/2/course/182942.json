In this course, I hope to guide you through a general history of fiction in British and American writing. The books we are reading (Jane Eyre [1847], Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland [1865], Huckleberry Finn [1884], and 1984 [1949]), are books that people in Britain or the U.S. would be nearly as likely to pick up for fun as they would be to read them in class. They\u2019re also books that almost everyone knows something about\u2014even if individuals haven\u2019t read the book. Knowing these books and the context they came out of will give you the ability to understand many ideas that are central to British and American identity and culture. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the main texts we read, in class we will do a general study of prose fiction from one of the first printed works in English, Malory\u2019s Morte d\u2019Arthur (printed by William Caxton in 1485) onward. Through informal investigations and in-class activities, you will learn the literary and historical context of the novel in each era. How has fiction changed from 1485 to the present? How did the purpose of writing change? How have tastes changed? And why are these changes important?     \r\n\r\nTEXTS\r\nJane Eyre (Charlotte Bronte)\r\nAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Lewis Carroll)\r\nHuckleberry Finn (Mark Twain)\r\n1984 (George Orwell)\r\n\r\nAdditional Readings will be provided in the Course Packet and or e-mailed to you.", "schedule": "Please see the professor for this information as she uses a chart that cannot easily be uploaded. We will be reading sections of Gulliver's Travels in the second week, spending weeks three through eight on Jane Eyre and Alice in Wonderland, spending weeks eight through ten on Huckleberry Finn, and spending weeks eleven through fifteen on 1984. There is one paper (due week thirteen) and a final exam.", "scorePolicy": "Grade Percentages:\r\nI may modify these grade weights at my discretion.
