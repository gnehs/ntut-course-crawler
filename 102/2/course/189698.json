The course will prepare them for future classes and their senior project as well as giving students general writing skills that they can apply in any future English writing. This course will help students organize and present ideas in clear, fluent, logical paragraphs. Students will learn to analyze their own voice, style, and word choice with the goal of becoming more creative at the same time as they learn to write more clearly. We will workshop papers in small groups and as a class, helping students analyze their own and other students\u2019 writing. As necessary, we will review important grammatical points.", "schedule": "Please see the professor as she uses a chart format for due dates that is difficult to upload. Formal papers are due in week nine, week fifteen, and week eighteen. You will also have many other drafts to write and library-based researching projects.", "scorePolicy": "Grade Percentages:\r\n\r\nFormal Papers: 50%\r\nInformal Writing: 10%\r\nParticipation: 10%\r\nPeer Reviews: 5%\r\nHomework and quizzes: 25%\r\n\r\nI may modify these grade weights at my discretion.

The only way to outright fail this course is through lack of effort. The student may not participate in classroom work or may be absent more than three times. Assignments are either (a) completed but not completed at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit; (b) frequently late, thereby lowering the grade too significantly to give the student a chance to pass; or (c) never completed at all.", "materials": "SUPPLIES\r\n\u2027\tCourse Packet and/or e-mailed readings and handouts.
