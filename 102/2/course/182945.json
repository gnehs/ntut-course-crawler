However, the listening, note-taking, reading, writing, and discussion tasks help students develop the skills they need for study in any academic discipline. Dialogue journals will be used as the method of providing students with the opportunity to improve English writing.  Both intensive and extensive reading will be practiced inside and outside of class.  \r\n\r\nCourse Objectives:  By the end of the course students will have shown:\r\n\u2027\tknowledge of how to take notes on academic lectures to answer questions.  \r\n\u2027\tthe ability to participate in class discussions.\r\n\u2027\tknowledge of how to appropriately apply vocabulary, reading, and writing skills. \r\n\u2027\tability to read intensively and extensively to acquire content knowledge.  \r\n\r\nInstructional Activities:  This course is first and foremost a reading course.  Students will follow their textbook as it guides them in the acquisition of American history and culture as course content.  Dialogue journals will be used to allow students the opportunity to critique what has been discussed during class.  Students will practice a number of note-taking and reading comprehension tasks inside of class. One intensive reading assignment will be completed in class that will require students to read a lengthy piece of writing without the aid of a dictionary in a short period of time.  Students are encouraged to preview all the material before class in order to not fall behind.  \r\n\r\nDialogue journals are written conversations between student and teacher.  Topics will be selected by both the student and by the teacher.  Students will write an entry and the teacher responds.  The student then reads what the teacher has written and responds.  The student determines how long or short the entry will be.  This will decide how long or short the reply from the teacher will be.  This journal will provide a student with the opportunity to practice writing at one\u2019s own level, receive individualized attention and regular positive feedback, write and read for authentic purpose \u2013to communicate (fluency) but have the teacher model correct usage (accuracy), have the opportunity for reflection and personal response, and have a record of written language development.  This type of writing also allows the teacher to become more acquainted with individual students, provide individualized instruction, and receive frequent assessment of student progress.  There will be time set aside at the beginning of each class for dialogue journal writing tim", "schedule": "Weekly Schedule:\r\nWeek\tDate\tClass Work\tHomework\r\nWeek 1\t2/20\t\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5927\u7db1\u7c21\u4ecb\r\nDialogue Journal Writing #1 (Written Prompt)\t\r\nWeek 2\t2/27\tReading \u2013 Chapter 6 pp. 119- 140\r\nDialogue Journal Writing #2 (Written Prompt) \u2013 p. 139-140\t\r\nWeek 3\t3/6\tReading \u2013 Chapter 7 pp. 141-163\r\nDialogue Journal Writing #3 (Written Prompt) \u2013 p. 164-165\t\r\nWeek 4\t3/13\tReading \u2013 Chapter 8 pp. 166-184\r\nDialogue Journal Writing #4 (Written Prompt) \u2013 p. 185-186\t\r\nWeek 5\t3/20\tReading \u2013 Chapter 9 pp. 187-208\r\nDialogue Journal Writing #5 (Written Prompt) \u2013 p. 209-210\t\r\nWeek 6\t3/27\tReading \u2013 Chapter 10 pp. 211-231 \r\nDialogue Journal Writing #6 (Written Prompt) \u2013 p. 232-233\t\r\nWeek 7\t4/3\tHoliday Compensation for Sports Day\t\r\nWeek 8\t4/10\tDialogue Journal Writing #7 (Video Prompt) \r\nListening Chapter 6 p. 81-96\t\u6e96\u5099\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\r\nWeek 9\t4/17\tReading/Writing\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\t\r\nWeek 10\t4/24\tDialogue Journal Writing #8 (Video Prompt)\r\nListening Chapter 6 p. 81-96\t\r\nWeek 11\t5/1\tIntensive Reading Activity\t\r\nWeek 12\t5/8\tIntensive Reading Activity\t\r\nWeek 13\t5/15\tIntensive Reading Activity\t\r\nWeek 14\t5/22\tListening Chapter 7 p. 97-111\t\r\nWeek 15\t5/29\tListening Chapter 8 p. 112-128\t\r\nWeek 16\t6/5\tListening Chapter 9 p. 129-143\t\r\nWeek 17\t6/12\tListening Chapter 10 p. 144-159\t\u6e96\u5099\u671f\u672b\u8003\r\nWeek 18\t6/19\tListening/Note Taking\u671f\u672b\u8003", "scorePolicy": "Grading Procedures:  Course grades will be calculated in the following manner:\r\n\r\nReading/Writing\u671f\u4e2d\u8003 (Chapters 6-10)\t\t\t\t35%.\r\n\tListening/Note Taking\u671f\u672b\u8003 (Chapters 6-10)\t\t\t35%\r\n\t\u51fa\u5e2d\u7387\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\tIntensive Reading Activity\t\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\tDialogue Journals (x8)\t\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal:\t100 pts.\r\n\r\nA\t90-100\r\nB\t80-89\r\nC\t70-79\r\nD\t60-69\r\nF\t59 & BELOW", "materials": "Text and References:\t\r\nSanabria, K. & Sanabria, C.
