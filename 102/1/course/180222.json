What is the purpose of popular culture? What differentiates music, art, and literature that become popular among the masses from works that do not? Who decides what popular culture is, and who decides what high culture is? We will pay particular attention to the ways in which popular culture becomes high culture and vice versa. We will analyze how similar stories recur across various time periods and geographic regions, how modernity affects our view of culture and art, and how stories change when told in different genres. Students will make presentations about aspects of popular culture that interest them, will participate in in-class writing, quizzes, and exams, and will write two formal reflection papers.", "schedule": "Week 1\r\n9/10\r\nWhat is Pop Culture?\r\n \u201cCull vs. Surrender,\u201d George Orwell\u2019s \u201cGood Bad Books,\u201d\r\nFrom T.

The student is willing and able to contribute fruitfully and thoughtfully in class discussions, group work, and his or her presentations. Guidelines for technology use and class presence are always followed. \r\n\r\n5%\tParticipation\u2014English use. To get full credit in this section, the student speaks exclusively in English in class. (It\u2019s good for you!) Instead of saying Chinese words, the student thinks of a way to rephrase what s/he wants to say in English in a way that the other student will understand. If communication fails, the student asks me for and gets permission to say a word in Chinese and then other students will try to help the student say what s/he means in English. I will give you three grace cards for any slip-ups. So long as you don\u2019t accidentally speak Chinese more than three times, you can still get full credit in this area. After three times, you can get up to 2% in this area if I see you are really trying to speak English. If you choose not to worry about your level of English use, you just won\u2019t earn this 5% in your final grade. \r\n\r\n20% \tIn-class Writing, Quizzes, and Informal Response Papers\r\n\r\n45%\tFormal Papers\r\n\r\n20%\tPresentations\r\n\r\nI may modify these percentages at my discretion.\r\n\r\nGrading Criteria:\r\n\r\nA\tSuperior work. Achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements.\r\nB\tAchievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements.\r\nC \tAchievement that meets the course requirements in every respect. \r\nD \tAchievement that fails to meet fully the course requirements. \r\nF \tAchievement that is not worthy of credit. The only way to outright fail this course is through lack of effort and/or plagiarism. The student may not participate in classroom work. Assignments are either (a) completed but not completed at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit; (b) frequently late, thereby lowering the grade too significantly to give the student a chance to pass; or (c) never completed at all.", "materials": "TEXTS\r\nJ.
