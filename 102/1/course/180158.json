However, the listening, note-taking, and discussion tasks help students develop the skills they need for study in any academic discipline.  Students are also given opportunities to practice giving individual/paired and group presentations over textbook content and researched information.  Listening activities will center on the listening of academic lectures and less formal interviews.  Dialogue journals will be used as the method of providing students with the opportunity to improve English writing.  \r\n\r\nCourse Objectives:  By the end of the course students will have:\r\n\u2027\tShown knowledge of how to take notes on academic lectures to answer questions.  \r\n\u2027\tShown written English improvement.\r\n\u2027\tSuccessfully given an individual/paired short presentation.\r\n\u2027\tSuccessfully done research and given short group presentations.\r\n\u2027\tShown the ability to participate in class discussions.\r\n\r\nInstructional Activities:  This course is first and foremost a discussion course.  Students must actively participate in class through discussion with the teacher and classmates.  Students will follow their textbook as it guides them in the discussion of American history and culture.  When expected, students are expected to present their ideas during presentations.  Dialogue journals will be used to allow students the opportunity to critically discuss what has been discussed during class.  \r\n\r\nDialogue journals are written conversations between student and teacher.  Topics will be selected by both the student and by the teacher.  Students will write an entry and the teacher responds.  The student then reads what the teacher has written and responds.  The student determines how long or short the entry will be.  This will decide how long or short the reply from the teacher will be.  This journal will provide a student with the opportunity to practice writing at one\u2019s own level, receive individualized attention and regular positive feedback, write and read for authentic purpose \u2013to communicate (fluency) but have the teacher model correct usage (accuracy), have the opportunity for reflection and personal response, and have a record of written language development.  This type of writing also allows the teacher to become more acquainted with individual students, provide individualized instruction, and receive frequent assessment of student progress.  There will be time set aside at the beginning of each class for dialogue journal writing time.  Students should retrieve their journals from the tea", "schedule": "Weekly Schedule:\r\nWeek\tDate\tClass Work\tHomework\r\nWeek 1\t9/12\t\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5927\u7db1\u7c21\u4ecb\r\n\u8a5e\u5f59\u80fd\u529b\u6e2c\u9a57\t\u8cb7\u8ab2\u672c\u2014XXXX p. xxiii; Review the map on page xxv\r\nWeek 2\t9/19\t\u8001\u5e2b\u751f\u65e5\uff0d\u505c\u8ab2\u4e00\u6b21 (\u4e5f\u662f\u4e2d\u79cb\u7bc0\uff0dhahaha)\t\r\nWeek 3\t9/26\tChapter 1: The Foundations of Government\t\r\nWeek 4\t10/3\tChapter 1: The Foundations of Government\t\r\nWeek 5\t10/10\t\u570b\u6176\u65e5\uff0d\u81fa\u7063No. 1\uff0d\u505c\u8ab2\u4e00\u6b21\t\r\nWeek 6\t10/17\tChapter 2: Constitutional Issues Today\t\r\nWeek 7\t10/24\tChapter 2: Constitutional Issues Today\t\r\nWeek 8\t10/31\tChapter 3: The Origins of Diversity\t\u6e96\u5099\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\r\nWeek 9\t11/7\t\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\t\r\nWeek 10\t11/14\tChapter 3: The Origins of Diversity\tPrepare Group Presentations (#1)\r\nWeek 11\t11/21\tGroup Presentations\t\r\nWeek 12\t11/28\tChapter 4: Diversity in Today\u2019s United States\t\r\nWeek 13\t12/5\tChapter 4: Diversity in Today\u2019s United States\tPrepare Individual/Paired Presentations\r\nWeek 14\t12/12\tIndividual/Paired Presentations\t\r\nWeek 15\t12/19\tChapter 5: The Struggle Begins\t\r\nWeek 16\t12/26\tChapter 5: The Struggle Begins\tPrepare Group Presentations (#2)\r\nWeek 17\t1/2\tGroup Presentations\t\u6e96\u5099\u671f\u672b\u8003\r\nWeek 18\t1/9\t\u671f\u672b\u8003", "scorePolicy": "Grading Procedures:  Course grades will be calculated in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\u671f\u4e2d\u8003 (Chapters 1-2)\t\t\t\t\t\t20%.\r\n\t\u671f\u672b\u8003 (Chapters 3-5)\t\t\t\t\t\t30%\r\n\t\u51fa\u5e2d\u7387\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\tTwo Group Presentations\t\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\tIndividual (or Paired) Presentation\t\t\t\t\t10%\r\n\tDialogue Journals\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20%\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal:\t100 pts.\r\n\r\nA\t90-100\r\nB\t80-89\r\nC\t70-79\r\nD\t60-69\r\nF\t59 & BELOW", "materials": "\u4e0a\u8ab2\u898f\u5247:\r\n1.\t\u8001\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u6642\uff0c\u8acb\u540c\u5b78\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u975c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8207\u540c\u5b78\u4ea4\u982d\u63a5\u8033\u3002\r\n2.\t\u4e0a\u8ab2\u4e2d\u8acb\u52ff\u88fd\u9020\u566a\u97f3(\u4f8b\u5982\u96a8\u610f\u8b1b\u8a71\uff0c\u5927\u8072\u6574\u7406\u6771\u897f\uff0c\u6454\u9580\uff0c\u7b49\u7b49) \u3002\r\n3.\t\u4e0a\u8ab2\u6642\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5403\u6771\u897f\uff08\u5169\u5802\u8ab2\u4e2d\u9593\u4f11\u606f\u6642\u53ef\u4ee5\uff09\u3002\u98f2\u6599\u6c92\u554f\u984c\u3002\r\n4.\t\u4e0d\u4f86\u4e0a\u8ab2\u7684\u540c\u5b78\u6ce8\u610f\u5594\uff01\u8981\u88dc\u8003\uff08\u5c0f\uff1b\u671f\u4e2d\uff1b\u671f\u672b\uff09\u7684\u5b78\u751f\u5fc5\u9808\u51fa\u793a\u91ab\u751f\u958b\u7acb\u4e4b\u8b49\u660e\u6216\u8a03\u805e\u624d\u53ef\u4ee5\u88dc\u8003\u3002", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
