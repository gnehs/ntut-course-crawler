Given the fact that this discipline exercises huge impacts on lives as well as built and natural environments, each question must be examined in terms of what is morally right or wrong at the same time. The progression of this semester will be structured by topics in environmental ethics and divided into three parts: A. Basic concepts, B. Environmental ethics as applied ethics, and C. Theories of environmental ethics. Meanwhile, the course aims also at preparing students for ethical difficulties they will come across at work and enhance their sense of responsibility. Different moral dilemmas that architects encounter generally in professional practice will be regularly proposed and discussed in class. The case studies will be taken from five categories: 1. General obligations, 2. Obligations to the public, 3. Obligations to the client, 4. Obligations to the profession, 5. Obligations to colleagues.\r\n\r\n\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6a19\u662f\u671f\u5f85\u5b78\u751f\u4e0d\u518d\u55ae\u7d14\u628a\u5efa\u7bc9\u8996\u70ba\u4e00\u500b\u7d93\u6fdf\u7684\u6216\u7f8e\u5b78\u7684\u554f\u984c\u3002\u9452\u65bc\u9019\u500b\u9818\u57df\u5c0d\u4eba\u9020\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u7136\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u554f\u984c\u90fd\u61c9\u540c\u6642\u7531\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0a\u7684\u5c0d\u8207\u932f\u9019\u500b\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f86\u9032\u884c\u5be9\u8996\u3002\u672c\u5b78\u671f\u7684\u9032\u5ea6\u5c07\u7531\u74b0\u5883\u502b\u7406\u5b78\u7684\u8b70\u984c\u6240\u69cb\u6210\uff0c\u4e26\u5206\u70ba\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u5927\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4e00\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e8c\u3001\u4f5c\u70ba\u61c9\u7528\u502b\u7406\u5b78\u7684\u74b0\u5883\u502b\u7406\u5b78\uff0c\u4e09\u3001\u74b0\u5883\u502b\u7406\u5b78\u7406\u8ad6\u3002\u9019\u9580\u8ab2\u540c\u6642\u5e0c\u671b\u5354\u52a9\u540c\u5b78\u8655\u7406\u672a\u4f86\u6703\u5728\u8077\u5834\u4e0a\u9047\u5230\u7684\u502b\u7406\u56f0\u5883\u4e26\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u8cac\u4efb\u611f\u3002\u8ab2\u5802\u4e0a\u5c07\u56fa\u5b9a\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u5efa\u7bc9\u5e2b\u4e00\u822c\u6703\u5728\u5be6\u52d9\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5404\u985e\u9053\u5fb7\u5169\u96e3\uff0c\u4e26\u8b93\u540c\u5b78\u8a0e\u8ad6\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u53d6\u81ea\u4e94\u500b\u7bc4\u7587\uff1a\u4e00\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u8cac\u4efb\uff0c\u4e8c\u3001\u516c\u5171\u8cac\u4efb\uff0c\u4e09\u3001\u5c0d\u5ba2\u6236\u7684\u8cac\u4efb\uff0c\u56db\u3001\u8077\u696d\u9053\u5fb7\uff0c\u4e94\u3001\u5c0d\u540c\u4e8b\u7684\u8cac\u4efb\u3002", "schedule": "Week1.
