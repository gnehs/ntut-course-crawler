Linear Equations (Quiz #1 at the end of this chapter)\r\nTo understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\r\nSolving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form.\r\nTo interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\r\nFirst exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation.\r\n(7) 2. Matrix Algebra\r\nTo learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\r\nTo summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns.\r\n(12) 3. Vector Spaces (Midterm exam after Section 4.2)\r\nIntroduction to vector spaces.\r\nFundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\r\nBasis and dimension of a vector space.\r\n(8) 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (Quiz #2 after Section 5.2)\r\nTo find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.\r\nDiagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\r\nTo view eigenbases in the context of simplifying (decorrelating) linear transformations.\r\n(9) 5. Orthogonality and Inner-Product Spaces\r\nTo introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\r\nTo be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\r\nLeast-Squares approximation.\r\n(2) 6.
