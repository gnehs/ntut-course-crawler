Project I\u2014Reading the News\u2014emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.  Project II\u2014Critiquing the Arts\u2014involves a writing of analysis on a work of literature or art.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments.", "schedule": "Date\t Key Topic\r\n2/20\t Reading the News\u2014What\u2019s the story (pp. 235-240)\r\n2/27\t Reader at Work (pp. 242-3)\r\n          Writing a News Summary (pp. 250-2)\r\n3/5\t\u201cThe Noose Incident\u201d(pp. 268-271)\r\n3/12\t\u201cAn Appropriate Expression (pp. 271-4)\r\n3/19\t Role-playing (274-6)\r\n3/26\t Ithacan Inquirer (pp. 276-8)\r\n4/2\t Arguing Your Point of View (pp. 278-281)\r\n4/9\t Critiquing the Arts--Modes of Argument\r\n4/16\t Strategies of Critical Reading\r\n4/23\t\u201cHidden Dangers in the Ethnic Revival\u201d \r\n4/30\t Analysis and Argument\r\n5/7\t\u201cA Lack of Religious Values\u2026\u201d \r\n         \u201cOur Freedom is Threatened\u2026\u201d\r\n5/14\tAwareness of the Arts\r\n5/21\tFrom the Literal to the Suggestive\r\n5/28\tLiterary Significance\r\n        \u201cThe Book of the Grotesque\u201d\r\n6/4\tThe Formal Critique\r\n6/11\tReading Poems\r\n6/18\tDiscussion\r\n", "scorePolicy": "1.\tProject I: 20% \r\n2.\tProject II: 30%\r\n3.\tAssignments and In-class Practices: 40%\r\n4.\tPeer-reviewing and Comments: 10%\r\n", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
