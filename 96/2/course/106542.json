It also highlights the close relationship between language course design and teaching as the teacher builds on knowledge. Students will present and discuss the points of view of various practitioners and the professional community. They, therefore, are expected to finish the assigned readings before class and actively participate in class presentations and discussions.", "schedule": "Week 1    Introduction\r\nWeek 2    No Class!\r\nWeek 3    Chapter 1\r\nWeek 4    Chapter 2\r\nWeek 5    Chapter 3\r\nWeek 6    Chapter 4 (Part I)\r\nWeek 7    Chapter 4 (Part II)\r\nWeek 8    Chapter 5 (Parts I & II)\r\nWeek 9    Midterm\r\nWeek 10   Chapter 6 (Part I)\r\nWeek 11   Chapter 6 (Part II)\r\nWeek 12   Chapter 7\r\nWeek 13   Chapter 8 (Part I)\r\nWeek 14   Chapter 8 (Part II)\r\nWeek 15   Chapter 9\r\nWeek 16   Chapter 10\r\nWeek 17   Final\r\nWeek 18   Final", "scorePolicy": "Class Attendance: 10%\r\nClass Participation: 30%\r\nMidterm: 30%\r\nFinal: 30%", "materials": "Graves, K.
