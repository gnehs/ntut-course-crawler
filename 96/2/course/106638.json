Starting from a description of how signals can be represented as digital waveforms and how systems may be modeled as digital filters, the course investigates the processing and analysis of signals using the most common approaches and algorithms. It covers signal representation and Fourier transform, sampling theorem, discrete-time sys-tem representation and analysis, and FIR and IIR digital filter analysis and design.\r\n", "schedule": "1.\tIntroduction (Chap. 1 of textbook)\r\n2.\tSinusoids (Chap. 2)\r\n3.\tSpectrum representation (Chap. 3)\r\n4.\tSampling and aliasing (Chap. 4)\r\n5.\tFIR filters (Chap. 5)\r\n6.\tFrequency response of FIR filters (Chap. 6)\r\n7.\tz-transform (Chap. 7)\r\n8.\tIIR filters (Chap. 8)\r\n", "scorePolicy": "6-7 Homework + 3-4 Computer Assignment (Matlab)    15%\r\n2 Quizzes  (1 hour, 12.5% each, closed book)      25%\r\nMidterm Exam  (closed book)                 25%\r\nFinal Exam\t(closed book)                    35%\r\n", "materials": "Textbook: J.H.
