In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6750\u4e8c\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=943", "code": "943"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u5289\u79cb\u862d", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=11222", "code": "11222"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": ["1", "2"], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559307(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=48", "code": "48"}], "people": "26", "peopleWithdraw": "8", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "103128", "code": "1404004", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u53f2", "en": "The History of China"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ee5\u6b77\u53f2\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u95e1\u8ff0\u53ca\u5c08\u984c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u85c9\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u8a8d\u8b58\u6642\u4ee3\u4e4b\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u6388\u8ab2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u8b1b\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u8a0e\u8ad6\u53ca\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u8f14\uff0c\u671f\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\uff0c\u80fd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u6709\u4e00\u7c21\u8981\u800c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u3002\n", "en": "Methodologically, the course is performed in two ways at the same time: interpretation of historical trends as well as the study and analysis of specific topics.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

The Nineteenth Century : The Industrial Revolution was the major influence on architectural history development. Structures of this period were marvels of engineering using materials like iron, plate glass, and reinforced concrete in new types of construction. 2). Foundation of Modernism (1890-1920) : In this period, the art community, including Cubism, Expressionism, De Stijl, Futurism and Constructivism, greatly influenced the form of building. 3).Modernism(1920-1970) : In this period, emphasises were placed on the \"Less is More\" , historicism and ornament were abandoned, the replacement were form and function, reason and abstraction. 4).Postmodernism (1965-1989) : Postmodernism architecture is characterized by the idea of \"Less is Boring\", and was inspired by Classical tradition and historical precedents. 5).Contemporary

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The main subjects include English sentence structures, verbal usages, conjunctions, and sequences. Related topics for class discussion cover direct and indirect speech, sentence transformation and modification of sentences; (b) The second half of the course focuses on English rhetoric--principles of effective written and spoken communication. Topics for class discussion include reference, coherence, reverse structures and some related rhetorical concepts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u8cc7\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=957", "code": "957"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u5433\u83ef\u967d", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=10376", "code": "10376"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["1", "2"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559302(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=45", "code": "45"}], "people": "44", "peopleWithdraw": "4", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "103955", "code": "1404004", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u53f2", "en": "The History of China"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ee5\u6b77\u53f2\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u95e1\u8ff0\u53ca\u5c08\u984c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u85c9\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u8a8d\u8b58\u6642\u4ee3\u4e4b\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u6388\u8ab2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u8b1b\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u8a0e\u8ad6\u53ca\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u8f14\uff0c\u671f\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\uff0c\u80fd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u6709\u4e00\u7c21\u8981\u800c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u3002\n", "en": "Methodologically, the course is performed in two ways at the same time: interpretation of historical trends as well as the study and analysis of specific topics.

Lots of interaction with other students either in pairs or in small or large group activities will be emphasized.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "0.0", "hours": "1", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u8cc7\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=1057", "code": "1057"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u5f6d\u99a8\u5100", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=11174", "code": "11174"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": ["7"], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "57", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u8996\u807d\u6559\u5b78\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e0a\u8ab2"}, {"id": "103968", "code": "1404003", "name": {"zh": "\u570b\u6587", "en": "Chinese"}, "description": {"zh": "\u570b\u6587\uff0c\u662f\u904b\u7528\u672c\u570b\u8a9e\u8a00\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u860a\u91c0\u65bc\u6b23\u8cde\u6587\u85dd\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u5145\u5be6\u6587\u5316\u5167\u6db5\uff0c\u589e\u9032\u601d\u7dad\u80fd\u529b\u8207\u4eba\u6587\u7d20\u990a\u7684\u4e00\u9580\u8ab2\u7a0b\u3002\r\n\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5206\u70ba\u5927\u4e00\u4e0a\u5b78\u671f2\u5b78\u5206\uff0c\u5927\u4e00\u4e0b\u5b78\u671f2\u5b78\u5206\u3002\u5927\u4e00\u4e0a\u5b78\u671f\u7684\u6388\u8ab2\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u6587\u5b78\u540d\u7bc7\u70ba\u7bc4\u570d\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u85c9\u6b64\u64f4\u5efa\u5b78\u751f\u6df1\u5165\u54c1\u5473\u6587\u5b78\u8da3\u5473\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u935b\u934a\u9748\u6d3b\u7684\u8a9e\u6587\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9ed8\u5951\u6587\u5b78\u5275\u610f\uff0c\u751a\u800c\u5617\u8a66\u5275\u4f5c\u3002\u5927\u4e00\u4e0b\u5b78\u671f\u7684\u6388\u8ab2\u5167\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ee5\u601d\u60f3\u540d\u7bc7\u70ba\u7bc4\u570d\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u85c9\u6b64\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u900f\u8f4d\u5206\u6790\u5404\u5bb6\u5b78\u8aaa\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u6f2b\u6b65\u54f2\u4eba\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5929\u5730\uff0c\u8ddf\u96a8\u54f2\u4eba\u7684\u5fc3\u8def\u6b77\u7a0b\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u5ff5\u8332\u5728\u8332\uff0c\u5f9e\u5bb9\u5167\u5316\uff0c\u5171\u9957\u53d6\u4e4b\u4e0d\u76e1\u7528\u4e4b\u4e0d\u7aed\u7684\u5148\u9a57\u8207\u98a8\u7bc4\u3002\n", "en": "\"Chinese\" is the course where we make full use of our native languages to enjoy literary works, to enrich our cultural taste, to develop our thinking and even to elevate human cultivation.\r\n\r\nThis four-credit course is set for the freshman students: with 2 credits in each of the two semesters of the school year. In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u96fb\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=1000", "code": "1000"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8b1d\u4ec1\u771f", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=22336", "code": "22336"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["5", "6"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u56db\u6559202(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=73", "code": "73"}], "people": "43", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "104024", "code": "1404004", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u53f2", "en": "The History of China"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ee5\u6b77\u53f2\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u95e1\u8ff0\u53ca\u5c08\u984c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u85c9\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u8a8d\u8b58\u6642\u4ee3\u4e4b\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u6388\u8ab2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u8b1b\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u8a0e\u8ad6\u53ca\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u8f14\uff0c\u671f\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\uff0c\u80fd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u6709\u4e00\u7c21\u8981\u800c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u3002\n", "en": "Methodologically, the course is performed in two ways at the same time: interpretation of historical trends as well as the study and analysis of specific topics.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The curriculum structure starts from 50 basic Japanese pronouncing letters.

Who are we?  Where are we going?\"  The goal of studying philosophy of biology is to answer these questions.  So anyone interested in such questions needs to understand both the theories and the structure of this subject.  Most biologists agree that evolution is driven by natural selection, but there also exists a vocal and growing group of creationists and intelligent-design theorists.  What exactly is the debate between the two sides about?  Who's right and why?  Then we will move on to more specific issues about modern evolutionary theory.  For example:  Biology seems to have few if any laws of its own.  Why is that?  Also, questions concerning the units of selection, adaptationism, and systematics, etc.  Finally, we will get clear on what evolutionary theory means for our conception of ourselves.  Is there an essential human nature that we all share?  If evolution is right, does that mean we are incapable of genuine altruism?\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u901a\u8b58\u8ab2\u7a0b(\u4e00)", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=96&sem=1&code=82", "code": "82"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u694a\u666f\u5fb7", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=11223", "code": "11223"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["1", "2"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559207(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=96&sem=1&code=41", "code": "41"}], "people": "44", "peopleWithdraw": "3", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "109534", "code": "1410077", "name": {"zh": "\u6c34\u5f69", "en": "Watercolor Painting"}, "description": {"zh": "\u7d20\u63cf\u662f\u9020\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8a13\u7df4\uff0c\u6c34\u5f69\u5247\u70ba\u8272\u5f69\u7684\u7f8e\u611f\u8a13\u7df4\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5148\u4ee5\u5e7b\u71c8\u6559\u5b78\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6b23\u8cde\u4e2d\u5916\u540d\u5bb6\u7684\u6c34\u5f69\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u518d\u4f5c\u5be6\u969b\u6c34\u5f69\u756b\u7df4\u7fd2\u3002\u9996\u5148\u6559\u8abf\u8272\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8457\u6307\u5c0e\u975c\u7269\u3001\u6a39\u6728\u3001\u5efa\u7bc9\u7269\u7b49\u756b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u9054\u5230\u80fd\u5177\u5099\u5ba4\u5167\u975c\u7269\u756b\uff0c\u53ca\u5ba4\u5916\u98a8\u666f\u5beb\u751f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n", "en": "Sketch trains mold-making ability, and watercolor trains esthetic sense \r\nAbility of colors.

However, students in elementary and junior high schools still lack of the knowledge in this field. Therefore, the arrangement of lecture, camp, and religious construction regarding to the learning of Taiwanese folk religion is desirable.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.
