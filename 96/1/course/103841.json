It also highlights the important connections between design and proposal structure. Aiming at providing students with the knowledge regarding the logic and coherence of a qualitative study, it helps students learn the components of qualitative research design and the ways in which these relate to one another. Students then, through proposal writing, will learn to communicate and justify their own research design to a particular audience.", "schedule": "Week 1      Introduction & A Model for Qualitative Research Design\r\nWeek 2      No Class!\r\nWeek 3      Purposes: Why Are You Doing This Study?\r\nWeek 4      Conceptual Context: What Do You Think Is Going On?\r\nWeek 5      Research Questions: What Do You Want to Understand?\r\nWeek 6      Methods: What Will You Actually Do?\r\nWeek 7      Research Proposals: Presenting and Justifying a       \r\n            Qualitative Study\r\nWeek 8      Validity: How Might You Be Wrong?\r\nWeek 9      Final: Group Research Proposal", "scorePolicy": "Class Attendance\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 10%\r\nClass Participation\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202640%\r\nFinal\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650%\r\n", "materials": "Handouts of components of qualitative research design, including purposes, conceptual context, research questions, methods, and validity, as well as proposal writing", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
