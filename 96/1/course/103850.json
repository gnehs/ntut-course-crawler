Beautiful or not, alternative forms of art have become increasingly influential in shaping our culture and our daily lives, from television, to pop music, to advertising, to online games.\r\nStudying films, paintings, music and other forms of pop culture, we will consider the nature and significance of pop culture in the West and in the East.  Among the questions we will ask:  How does pop culture differ from traditional or \u201chigh\u201d culture?  What are the standards for evaluating such works?  Is there a difference between good and bad pop culture \u2013 can what is popular be good; must what is popular be good?\r\n", "schedule": "Week 1\t9/21\tIntroduction\r\nWeek 2\t9/28\tMonty Python and the Holy Grail\r\nWeek 3\t10/5\tStudent responses:  MP\r\nX-files: \u201cPilot\u201d (ep.1)\r\n\r\nWeek 4\t10/12\tX-files: \u201cDeep Throat\u201d (ep 2)\r\nStudent responses: ep. 1\r\n\r\nWeek 5\t10/19\tX-files: \u201cTithonus\u201d\r\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer ep.1\r\n\r\nWeek 6\t10/26\tStudent responses: Scully and Buffy\r\nBuffy ep.2\r\n\r\nWeek 7\t11/2\tAnime: taking animation seriously (Ghost in the Shell)\r\nWeek 8\t11/9\tAnime:  taking animation seriously (Cowboy Bebop)\r\nWeek 9\t11/16\tAnime discussion:  Ghost and Bebop\r\nWeek 10\t11/23\tAnime:  self-referentiality (comic party / genshiken)\r\nMidterm essay due\r\n\r\nWeek 11\t11/30\tGhost World\r\nWeek 12\t12/7\tStudent Responses:  Ghost World\r\nWeek 13\t12/14\tStudent presentations\r\nWeek 14\t12/21        Student presentations\r\nWeek 15\t12/28\tStudent presentations\r\nWeek 16\t1/4\tSong Lyrics\r\nWeek 17\t1/11\tSong Lyrics\r\nWeek 18\t1/18\tFINAL EXAM\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Midterm  33%\r\nFinal\t33%\r\nShort Assignments and Class Presentations/ Participation  33%\r\n", "materials": "Books:\r\ncourse book\r\n", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
