L. Doctorow\u2019s The Book of Daniel (1971) and Ragtime. In the former we will investigate the phenomenon of an era, which could roughly be called McCarthyism, and its impact on American culture and the lives of a specific American family. In the latter, we will examine the state of racial issues and conflicts through Doctorow\u2019s impressionistic presentation of the lives of two families who are counterparts in relation to other lines of the stories sketchily integrated as a whole. Given the limited amount of time we have in class, we will discuss The Book of Daniel in depth, leaving Ragtime for you to consume outside the class. In addition, you are required to read on your own Conversations with E. L. Doctorow to enrich your knowledge of Doctorow and the contemporary novel addressed in the books. We will not have a midterm, but a final examination will be given at the end of the semester. In between the opening of the class and the final, I expect you to engage in active participation in class discussion. In the last four class meeting of this semester before the final, you will be required to deliver oral presentations on Ragtime and Conversations with E. L. Doctorow. We will discuss how the oral presentations could be arranged.
