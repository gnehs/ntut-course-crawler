In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of exploration and discovery, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  adventure stories from film, legend, fable; non-fiction accounts of archaeological and historical people and events; narratives of our own personal quests and discoveries.", "schedule": "Week 1\t9/19\tIntro\r\nWeek 2\t9/26\tChildhood Hero (\u201cWho I wanted to be\u201d)\r\nWeek 3\t10/3\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 4\t10/10\tno class (holiday)\r\nWeek 5\t10/17\tInterview:  explorers\r\nWeek 6\t10/24\tPersonal object with a history\r\nWeek 7\t10/31\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 8\t11/7\t20 questions: invention\r\nWeek 9\t11/14\tMIDTERM\r\nWeek 10\t11/21\tgroup story\r\nWeek 11\t11/28\tstory and picture\r\nWeek 12\t12/5\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 13\t12/12\tquotations: explorers and discovers\r\nWeek 14\t12/19         News report:  \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the news\r\nWeek 15\t12/26\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 16\t1/2\tFilm:\r\nWeek 17\t1/9\tfilm review\r\nWeek 18\t1/16\tFINAL EXAM\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Midterm  33.3%\r\nFinal  33.3%\r\nParticipation  33.3%\r\n\r\nGrading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\r\n", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
