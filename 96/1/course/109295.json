Throughout the course, students learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.  By using a dynamic, dialogic approach, students are exposed to various perspectives and guided to think critically and write effectively as they move toward two writing projects on self-exploration (\u201cStories from My Life\u201d and \u201cGoing to College\u201d).", "schedule": "Weekly Schedule\r\n  \r\nDate\tKey Topic\tR        Reading\t\r\n9/19\tIntroduction\tMisconceptions about Writing\t\r\n9/26\tObserving\tFlower(11-3); Nike (handout)\t\r\n10/3\tFree Association or Writing from a List & \u201cMy Name\u201d(24)\r\n        \u201cto gloria, who is she\u201d(25-6)\t\r\n10/10\tHoliday\t\t\r\n10/17\tBeing specific\t\u201cThe Match\u201d by Fred Cox (handout)\t\u201cStories from my Life\r\n10/24\tDialogue with a Tex \u201cBeauty: When the Other...\u201d(39-44\t\r\n10/31\tPoint of View\t     \u201c\tWriting Through Acting\r\n11/7\tDeveloping your Writing\t\u201cI Remember\u201d (47-52)\t\r\n11/14\tMoving toward  Significance\t\u201cFish Cheeks\u201d (66-7);\r\n        \u201cAnnie John\u201d (61-3)\t\r\n11/21\tGetting an Outside Review\t\u201cMy Daughter Smokes\u201d (73-75)\t\u201cStories from my Life\u201d \r\n11/28\tReading & Reflecting on \u201cGoing to College\u201d\t\r\n        \u201cGoing to College\u201d by Jane Ellen Wilson (104-11)\r\n12/5\tNote making & Note taking\t\u201cGoing to College\u201d \r\n         by Karen Wong (113-4)\t\r\n12/12    College is a Waste of Time and Money\u201d by Caroline Bird\r\n         (114-22)\t\r\n12/19\tMaking Connections\t\u201cLetters to the Editor\u201d (123-7)\t\r\n12/26\tCritical Thinking\t\u201cThe Price of Learning\u201d (133-4);\r\n        \u201cOnly Daughter\u201d (151-4)\t\r\n1/2\tMaking Additions & Clarification\u201d\t\u201cGoing to College\u201d\r\n         (167-8; 173-5; 176-8; 178-81)\t\r\n1/9\tOrganization & Clarity\t \r\n1/16\tComments and Discussion\t\t\r\n\r\n", "scorePolicy": "1.\tMidterm Project: 20%\r\n2.\tFinal Project: 30%\r\n3.\tIn-class writing and Practices: 30%\r\n4.\tPeer-reviewing and Comments: 10%\r\n5.\tAttendance and Class Participation: 10%\r\n", "materials": "Pamela Gay.
