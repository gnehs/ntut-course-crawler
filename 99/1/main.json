The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us.  These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.  Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u4e8c\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1236", "code": "1236"}, {"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u4e8c\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1237", "code": "1237"}, {"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u4e8c\u4e19", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1238", "code": "1238"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5de5\u4e8c\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1253", "code": "1253"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5efa\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1255", "code": "1255"}, {"name": "\u56db\u82f1\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1258", "code": "1258"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1265", "code": "1265"}, {"name": "\u56db\u8eca\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1393", "code": "1393"}], "teacher": [], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["1", "2"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "0", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u8acb\u9078\u535a\u96c5\u6838\u5fc3--\u54f2\u5b78(\u4e00)"}, {"id": "137277", "code": "1102004", "name": {"zh": "\u8ecd\u8a13(\u4e09)", "en": "Military Training(III)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5927\u4e8c\u4e0a\u5b78\u671f\u70ba\u8ecd\u8a13\uff08\u4e09\uff09\u5169\u5b78\u5206\u9078\u4fee\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u5217\u4e09\u55ae\u5143\u4e2d\u9078\u64c7\u5169\u8005\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u4e86\u89e3\u6211\u570b\u56fa\u6709\u5175\u5b78\u601d\u60f3\u3001\u6230\u722d\u539f\u7406\u3001\u539f\u5247\u53ca\u6230\u722d\u6307\u5c0e\u85dd\u8853\uff0c\u555f\u767c\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u5175\u5b78\u7814\u7a76\u4e4b\u8208\u8da3\uff0c\u589e\u9032\u8ecd\u4e8b\u4fee\u990a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u6c11\u570b\u9632\u5171\u8b58\uff0c\u4ee5\u7dad\u8b77\u570b\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u6b66\u5668\u53ca\u6b66\u5668\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u76ee\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u570b\u6240\u767c\u5c55\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u5f0f\u6b66\u5668\u80fd\u4f5c\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u6211\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\u6210\u5c31\u6709\u6240\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u555f\u767c\u9752\u5e74\u5b78\u751f\u53c3\u8207\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\u8b77\u7406\u8207\u5065\u5eb7\uff0d\uff0d\u6982\u8ff0\u540c\u5927\u4e00\u5973\u751f\u90e8\u4efd\u3002\r\n\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\uff0d\uff0d\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u6b66\u5668\u53ca\u6b66\u5668\u7cfb\u7d71\u8207\u76ee\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u570b\u6240\u767c\u5c55\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u5f0f\u6b66\u5668\u80fd\u4f5c\u6709\u7cfb\u7d71\u7684\u8a8d\u8b58\uff0c\u4e26\u5c0d\u6211\u570b\u7368\u7acb\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u767c\u5c55\u6210\u5c31\u6709\u6240\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u555f\u767c\u9752\u5e74\u5b78\u751f\u53c3\u8207\u570b\u9632\u79d1\u6280\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8208\u8da3\u3002\r\n\u8b77\u7406\u8207\u5065\u5eb7\uff0d\uff0d\u6982\u8ff0\u540c\u5927\u4e00\u5973\u751f\u90e8\u4efd\u3002\n", "en": "Military Training includes three Courses at the first semester of second year.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course. Systematic study of this advanced structural geology course includes several topics: mechanic proporties and deformation behaviors of rocks, strain analysis, ductile geologic structures, brittle geologic structures, and applied structural geology.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6750\u4e09\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1145", "code": "1145"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u7f85\u5049", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=11170", "code": "11170"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["3", "4"], "thu": ["1"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559205(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=23", "code": "23"}], "people": "16", "peopleWithdraw": "1", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "137825", "code": "3324103", "name": {"zh": "\u74b0\u5883\u4fdd\u80b2", "en": "Environmental Protection"}, "description": {"zh": "\u7531\u65bc\u5de5\u696d\u767c\u5c55\u5e36\u4f86\u4e86\u5404\u7a2e\u74b0\u5883\u7684\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u7136\u751f\u614b\u906d\u5230\u7834\u58de\uff0c\u4eba\u985e\u5065\u5eb7\u53d7\u5230\u50b7\u5bb3\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u70ba\u5206\u6790\u6c59\u67d3\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e26\u63a2\u8a0e\u5982\u4f55\u6e1b\u8f15\u6c61\u67d3\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u5b78\u7fd2\u8005\u4e86\u89e3\u4e8b\u524d\u9632\u7bc4\u53ca\u4e8b\u5f8c\u88dc\u6551\u4e4b\u5c0d\u7b56\u3002\n", "en": "Introduction the methods of environmental protection.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6750\u4e09\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1145", "code": "1145"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u9b4f\u7a3d\u751f", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=20122", "code": "20122"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["8", "9"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559201(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=19", "code": "19"}], "people": "15", "peopleWithdraw": "1", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "137830", "code": "1001001", "name": {"zh": "\u9ad4\u80b2", "en": "Physical Education"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u6821\u9ad4\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u76ee\u6a19\u70ba\u935b\u934a\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u5fc3\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5168\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u904b\u52d5\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u767c\u63da\u5718\u968a\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u990a\u6210\u7d42\u8eab\u904b\u52d5\u7fd2\u6163\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e00\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u666e\u901a\u73ed\u9ad4\u80b2\u6b63\u8ab2\u6559\u5b78\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u5c08\u9805\u5206\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u7531\u5177\u6709\u5c08\u9577\u4e4b\u6559\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u3002\u958b\u8ab2\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u7c43\u7403\u3001\u6392\u7403\u3001\u684c\u7403\u3001\u7fbd\u7403\u3001\u4fdd\u9f61\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u7bad\u3001\u9ad8\u723e\u592b\u7403\u3001\u7db2\u7403\u3001\u9ad4\u64cd\u904a\u6232\u3001\u6162\u901f\u58d8\u7403\u3001\u592a\u6975\u62f3\u3001\u570b\u969b\u6a19\u6e96\u821e\u3001\u9ad4\u9069\u80fd\u3001\u570b\u8853\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u5f97\u6309\u81ea\u5df1\u8208\u8da3\u9078\u64c7\u4fee\u7fd2\u3002\u672c\u6821\u9ad4\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u76ee\u6a19\u70ba\u935b\u934a\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u5fc3\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5168\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u904b\u52d5\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u767c\u63da\u5718\u968a\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u990a\u6210\u7d42\u8eab\u904b\u52d5\u7fd2\u6163\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e00\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u666e\u901a\u73ed\u9ad4\u80b2\u6b63\u8ab2\u6559\u5b78\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u5c08\u9805\u5206\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u7531\u5177\u6709\u5c08\u9577\u4e4b\u6559\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u3002\u958b\u8ab2\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u7c43\u7403\u3001\u6392\u7403\u3001\u684c\u7403\u3001\u7fbd\u7403\u3001\u4fdd\u9f61\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u7bad\u3001\u9ad8\u723e\u592b\u7403\u3001\u7db2\u7403\u3001\u9ad4\u64cd\u904a\u6232\u3001\u6162\u901f\u58d8\u7403\u3001\u592a\u6975\u62f3\u3001\u570b\u969b\u6a19\u6e96\u821e\u3001\u9ad4\u9069\u80fd\u3001\u570b\u8853\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u5f97\u6309\u81ea\u5df1\u8208\u8da3\u9078\u64c7\u4fee\u7fd2\u3002\n", "en": "All students are required to attend two hours per week of Physical Education class.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us.  These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.  Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5de5\u4e8c\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1252", "code": "1252"}, {"name": "\u56db\u7ba1\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1259", "code": "1259"}, {"name": "\u56db\u6a5f\u96fb\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1262", "code": "1262"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5206\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1386", "code": "1386"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5b50\u4e00\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1387", "code": "1387"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5b50\u4e00\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1388", "code": "1388"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1401", "code": "1401"}], "teacher": [], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["7", "8"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "0", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u8acb\u9078\u535a\u96c5\u6838\u5fc3--\u54f2\u5b78(\u4e8c)"}, {"id": "138216", "code": "1401032", "name": {"zh": "\u5fae\u7a4d\u5206", "en": "Calculus"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4e00\u5b78\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5c0d\u5fae\u5206\u53ca\u7a4d\u5206\u6709\u5145\u5206\u7684\u77ad\u89e3\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u908f\u8f2f\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u555f\u767c\u601d\u8003\u5275\u9020\u3001\u5f37\u5316\u8a08\u7b97\u6f14\u7e79\u4e26\u6ce8\u91cd\u61c9\u7528\u8207\u4f5c\u5716\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u540c\u5b78\u672a\u4f86\u5b78\u7fd2\u5de5\u7a0b\u6578\u5b78\u53ca\u76f8\u95dc\u5c08\u696d\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e4b\u6578\u5b78\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u9054\u5230\u5b78\u4ee5\u81f4\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5167\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1.\u6975\u9650\u8207\u9023\u7e8c\uff0c2.\u5c0e\u6578\u53ca\u5176\u61c9\u7528\uff0c3.\u4e0d\u5b9a\u7a4d\u5206\u8207\u5b9a\u7a4d\u5206\uff0c4.\u8d85\u8d8a\u51fd\u6578\u53ca\u5176\u53cd\u51fd\u6578\uff0c5.\u7a4d\u5206\u6cd5\u5247\uff0c6.\u4e0d\u5b9a\u578b\u8207\u7455\u7a4d\u5206\uff0c7.\u5b9a\u7a4d\u5206\u7684\u61c9\u7528\uff0c8.\u7a7a\u9593\u5e7e\u4f55\u8207\u5411\u91cf\u5fae\u7a4d\u5206\uff0c9.\u504f\u5c0e\u6578\uff0c10.\u91cd\u7a4d\u5206\u3002\n", "en": "This course aims at developing comprehension of Derivation and Integral\u3001activating capabilities of Logic Inference and Induction\u3001enlightening confidence and independence\u3001strengthening calculating abilities with an emphasis on its application and diagram\u3001furnishing a sound basis for future specialty.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5efa\u4e09", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1154", "code": "1154"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u9673\u6f54\u660e", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=21730", "code": "21730"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["1", "2"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559406(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=54", "code": "54"}], "people": "54", "peopleWithdraw": "2", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "138426", "code": "1400211", "name": {"zh": "\u4eba\u6b0a\u8207\u6cd5\u5f8b", "en": "Human Rights & Laws"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5ee3\u7fa9\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5305\u62ec\u61b2\u6cd5\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u547d\u4ee4\u7b49\u3002\u4f5c\u70ba\u570b\u5bb6\u6700\u9ad8\u898f\u7bc4\u7684\u61b2\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u50f9\u503c\u5728\u65bc\u7dad\u8b77\u4eba\u6027\u5c0a\u56b4\uff1b\u5176\u6240\u8981\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6b0a\uff08\u81ea\u7531\u6b0a\u3001\u5e73\u7b49\u6b0a\u3001\u751f\u5b58\u6b0a\u3001\u8ca1\u7522\u6b0a\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6b0a\u2026\u2026\uff09\u3001\u53d7\u76ca\u6b0a\u3001\u53c3\u653f\u6b0a\u3001\u4eba\u683c\u6b0a\u7b49\uff0c\u5747\u6709\u8cf4\u76f8\u95dc\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u5be6\u8e10\u65b9\u80fd\u843d\u5be6\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u63a2\u8a0e\u61b2\u653f\u9ad4\u5236\u7684\u904b\u4f5c\u3001\u4eba\u6c11\u6b0a\u5229\u7fa9\u52d9\u7684\u898f\u7bc4\u53ca\u76f8\u95dc\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7684\u9069\u7528\u7b49\u554f\u984c\u3002\u671f\u80fd\u8a8d\u77e5\u570b\u5bb6\u6c11\u4e3b\u6cd5\u6cbb\u7684\u5be6\u65bd\u72c0\u6cc1\uff0c\u7dad\u8b77\u793e\u6703\u79e9\u5e8f\u8207\u500b\u4eba\u57fa\u672c\u6b0a\u5229\uff0c\u9032\u800c\u9ad4\u73fe\u4eba\u6027\u5c0a\u56b4\u7684\u50f9\u503c\u3002\n", "en": "Laws, if broadly defined, include constitutions, legal rules and orders.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

From putting continually the improved camera, video cassette recorder, copying machine, etc., to market can just account for how important a designing tool the Geometric-Optics is.To build a solid basic theory and a rule for calculating through understanding thoroughly the nature of light is the central goal of Optics. Using the basic theory of optics and processes of approximate estimate, the Geometric-Optics put its point on image formation and its applications.Here in our department, the Geometric-Optics is a 3-credit, 3-hour per week, one-semester course. There are three consecutives parts in the one-semester lecture:The 1st part : (a)the nature of light, (b)the related theorems about reflection and refraction, (c) image formation.The 2nd part : the formation and correctness of aberrations.The 3rd part : the designing of lenses.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5149\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1261", "code": "1261"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u6797\u4e16\u7a46", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10260", "code": "10260"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["5", "6", "7"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u5171\u540c413(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=157", "code": "157"}], "people": "68", "peopleWithdraw": "3", "ta": [{"name": "\u5289\u4f91\u6615          ", "link": "ShowTA.jsp?code=138762&ta=98658033  ", "code": "138762&ta=98658033  "}], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u56db\u5149\u4e8c\u8207\u56db\u96fb\u8cc7\u4e8c\u5408\u958b(\u965070\u4eba)"}, {"id": "138763", "code": "6502009", "name": {"zh": "\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(\u4e00)", "en": "Differential Equations(I)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5305\u542b: (1)\u4e00\u968e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c(2)\u9ad8\u968e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\uff0c(3)\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e4b\u51aa\u7d1a\u6578\u89e3\u6cd5\uff0c(4)\u908a\u754c\u503c\u554f\u984c\uff0c(5)\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u8f49\u63db\n", "en": "This course contains: (1)First-order ODEs,(2)Higher-order ODEs,(3)Series solutions of ODEs,(4)Boundary value problems,(5)Laplace Transform\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5149\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1261", "code": "1261"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u6797\u4e16\u8070", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10402", "code": "10402"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["3", "4"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["7"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u516d\u6559227(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=424", "code": "424"}, {"name": "\u516d\u6559727(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=452", "code": "452"}], "people": "84", "peopleWithdraw": "5", "ta": [{"name": "\u8b1d\u660e\u6f22          ", "link": "ShowTA.jsp?code=138763&ta=99658020  ", "code": "138763&ta=99658020  "}], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "138764", "code": "6502012", "name": {"zh": "\u5149\u96fb\u5de5\u7a0b\u6982\u8ad6 (\u4e00)", "en": "Introduction to Optoelectronic Engineering (I)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u70ba\u5149\u96fb\u79d1\u5b78\u4e4b\u6982\u5ff5\u4ecb\u7d39\uff0c\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3001\u56fa\u614b\u7269\u7406\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u5149\u7684\u8abf\u8b8a\u3001\u986f\u793a\u5668\u3001\u96f7\u5c04\u3001\u5149\u5075\u6e2c\u5668\u3001\u5149\u7e96\u7dad\u6ce2\u5c0e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u901a\u8a0a\u7cfb\u7d71\u3002\n", "en": "The course of Introduction to Optoelectronic Engineering introduces the concepts of the science of electro-optics.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill.

In 2002, related government agencies try to pormote the application of EEM , and attempt to adopt this specific measure. However, the lack of basic understanding and knowledge has been the main reason why engineers are struggling in introducing EEM into reality.

From putting continually the improved camera, video cassette recorder, copying machine, etc., to market can just account for how important a designing tool the Geometric-Optics is.To build a solid basic theory and a rule for calculating through understanding thoroughly the nature of light is the central goal of Optics. Using the basic theory of optics and processes of approximate estimate, the Geometric-Optics put its point on image formation and its applications.Here in our department, the Geometric-Optics is a 3-credit, 3-hour per week, one-semester course. There are three consecutives parts in the one-semester lecture:The 1st part : (a)the nature of light, (b)the related theorems about reflection and refraction, (c) image formation.The 2nd part : the formation and correctness of aberrations.The 3rd part : the designing of lenses.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u96fb\u8cc7\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1263", "code": "1263"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u6797\u4e16\u7a46", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10260", "code": "10260"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": ["5", "6", "7"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u5171\u540c413(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=157", "code": "157"}], "people": "11", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u56db\u5149\u4e8c\u8207\u56db\u96fb\u8cc7\u4e8c\u5408\u958b"}, {"id": "141277", "code": "3203047", "name": {"zh": "\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b78\u5de5\u7a0b", "en": "Biochemical Engineering"}, "description": {"zh": "\u7d50\u5408\u751f\u7269\u6280\u8853\u8207\u5316\u5de5\u539f\u7406\u4f86\u9032\u884c\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u3001\u52d5\u3001\u690d\u7269\u7d30\u80de\u4e4b\u57f9\u990a\u3001\u9175\r\n\u7d20\u4e4b\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u53cd\u61c9\u52d5\u529b\u5b78\u3001\u751f\u7269\u53cd\u61c9\u5668\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u8207\u76f8\u95dc\u53c3\u8003\u6578\u4e4b\u7372\u53d6\u6cd5\r\n\u3001\u7522\u54c1\u4e4b\u5206\u96e2\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7b49\u3002\n", "en": "In combination of biotechnology and chemical engineering to learn cell incubation, enzyme purification, bioreactor operation, and product separation, etc.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5316\u56db\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1041", "code": "1041"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5316\u56db\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1042", "code": "1042"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u4faf\u52ad\u6bc5", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=10955", "code": "10955"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": ["5"], "wed": [], "thu": ["3", "4"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559307(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=32", "code": "32"}, {"name": "\u79d1\u7814\u5927\u6a13242", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=461", "code": "461"}], "people": "15", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u4fee\u8ab2\u4e0a\u965035\u4eba"}, {"id": "141279", "code": "3203077", "name": {"zh": "\u592a\u967d\u5149\u96fb\u6c60\u61c9\u7528\u8207\u5c55\u671b", "en": "Technical progress and future prospect on solar photovoltaic"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5728\u6559\u6388\u5b78\u751f\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u5149\u96fb\u79d1\u6280\u53ca\u80fd\u6e90\u76f8\u95dc\u7522\u696d\u53ca\u88fd\u7a0b\u6280\u8853\u4e4b\u5be6\u52d9\u77e5\u8b58\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u8a2d\u8a08\u5c07\u8457\u91cd\u57fa\u790e\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u5149\u96fb\u79d1\u6280\u77e5\u8b58\u7684\u5efa\u7acb,\u9996\u5148\u4ecb\u7d39\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u5149\u96fb\u79d1\u6280\u6240\u61c9\u5177\u5099\u4e4b\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8b58,\u4e26\u6559\u6388\u80fd\u6e90\u6750\u6599\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u539f\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u76ee\u524d\u61c9\u7528\u6982\u6cc1.\u85c9\u7531\u8aaa\u660e\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u96fb\u6c60\u4e4b\u8a2d\u8a08\u539f\u7406\u8207\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e96\u5247\u70ba\u51fa\u767c\u9ede\uff0c\u6559\u5c0e\u5b78\u751f\u4e86\u89e3\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u5149\u96fb\u79d1\u6280\u6240\u61c9\u7528\u5230\u4e4b\u6750\u6599\u57fa\u672c\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u76f8\u95dc\u88fd\u4f5c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u5c07\u7531\u672c\u6821\u5c08\u4efb\u6559\u5e2b\u914d\u5408\u4f01\u696d\u8b1b\u5e2b\u548c\u6280\u8853\u5be6\u52d9\u5c08\u696d\u6559\u5e2b\u6f14\u8b1b,\u900f\u904e\u5be6\u4f8b\u4e4b\u8b1b\u89e3\u53ca\u5de5\u5ee0\u53c3\u89c0\uff0c\u5f15\u5c0e\u5b78\u751f\u4e86\u89e3\u61c9\u7528\u9818\u57df\u53ca\u88fd\u9020\u7522\u696d\u3002\u671f\u76fc\u57f9\u80b2\u5b78\u751f\u8fc5\u901f\u9032\u5165\u592a\u967d\u80fd\u5149\u96fb\u53ca\u80fd\u6e90\u6750\u6599\u76f8\u95dc\u7522\u696d\u5de5\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u8207\u7af6\u722d\u529b\u3002\n", "en": "The course is to provide the core knowledge for the development of solar energy technology.

It is also a fact that those who take better advantage of the right brain are very likely to be straightforward and thus seemingly more mechanical and unsympathetic. Economics can be seen as the mother of science under the condition that rational efficiency-as well as the socially humanity--are kept at the same time. As a matter of act, the economic trainings share the same goal as what is required by the General Education courses.\r\nThe first priority of the course is to highly motivate the students in the economic issues.

The main goal of the course is not only to improve the situation that our students have insufficient knowledge about folk religion, but also to help them apply the knowledge on the internet frequently. In addition, we will help students gain more information in this field and improve their learning quality of Taiwanese folk religion in Taiwan.

Songs are a rhythmic form of language. They record and reflect human histories before written symbols are invented. The history of songs can therefore best show specific historical changes. In early years of Taiwan aboriginal society, songs were used to entertain both gods and people and had social functions. As Han people brought in agriculture from mainland China, songs, poetry, and theater had closely related to sacrificial rites. In modern history, the development of recording history was driven by urbanization and industrialization.

The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us.  These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.  Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.  Given philosophy is such an activity based on thinking and reflection, learning philosophy hence can help us grasp the required knowledge concerning ourselves and our living world, and more importantly, prepare a thinking ability and reflecting attitude that are needed for us to succeed in becoming responsible social citizen.\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u901a\u8b58\u8ab2\u7a0b(\u4e94)", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=589", "code": "589"}], "teacher": [], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["7", "8"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "0", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u6559\u5e2b\u9ec3\u514b\u4ec1,\u5317\u5927\u4e09\u5cfd\u6821\u5340\u4eba\u6587\u5b78\u96621F09\u535a\u96c5\u9078\u4fee\u54f2\u5b78"}, {"id": "142436", "code": "1419976", "name": {"zh": "\u81ea\u7136\u79d1\u5b78\u6982\u8ad6", "en": "Elective  Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education\uff1aNature"}, "description": {"zh": "n\n", "en": "n\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u901a\u8b58\u8ab2\u7a0b(\u4e94)", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=589", "code": "589"}], "teacher": [], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["7", "8"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "0", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u6559\u5e2b\u5f6d\u737b\u751f,\u5317\u5927\u4e09\u5cfd\u6821\u5340\u793e\u79d1\u5b78\u96621F12\u535a\u96c5\u9078\u4fee\u81ea\u7136"}, {"id": "142437", "code": "1419974", "name": {"zh": "\u570b\u969b\u653f\u6cbb\u8207\u570b\u969b\u95dc\u4fc2", "en": "Elective  Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education\uff1aNomocracy"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6c11\u4e3b\u3001\u6cd5\u6cbb\u8ab2\u7a0b\u70ba\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u91cd\u5728\u5f37\u5316\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u7d20\u990a\uff0c\u589e\u9032\u653f\u6cbb\u9ad4\u5236\u53ca\u6cd5\u5f8b\u904b\u4f5c\u5be6\u52d9\u7b49\u4e4b\u76f8\u95dc\u8ab2\u7a0b\u3002\n", "en": "Democracy and nomocracy are the core curriculum, focusing on enhancing the quality of citizens and promoting the related courses in  the political system, the operation of the law practices and so on.\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u901a\u8b58\u8ab2\u7a0b(\u4e94)", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=589", "code": "589"}], "teacher": [], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": ["5", "6"], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "0", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u6559\u5e2b\u66fe\u79c0\u73cd,\u5317\u5927\u4e09\u5cfd\u6821\u5340\u4eba\u6587\u5b78\u96624F06\u535a\u96c5\u9078\u4fee\u6cd5\u6cbb"}, {"id": "142438", "code": "1419971", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u5bd3\u8a00\u5c0e\u8b80 A", "en": "Elective  Curriculum of Liberal Arts Education\uff1aCulture"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u6607\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u4eba\u6587\u7d20\u990a\u3002\u900f\u904e\u6587\u5b78\u6982\u8ad6\u3001\u85dd\u8853\u6982\u8ad6\u8207\u6587\u5316\u6982\u8ad6\u7b49\u76f8\u95dc\u8ab2\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5c0e\u5b78\u751f\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u5b78\u7684\u5999\u8da3\uff0c\u6b23\u8cde\u85dd\u8853\u7684\u7f8e\u8cea\uff0c\u77ad\u89e3\u6587\u5316\u7684\u50b3\u7d71\u3002\u5f9e\u53e4\u5178\u5230\u73fe\u4ee3\uff0c\u5f9e\u672c\u571f\u5230\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u5f9e\u7269\u8cea\u5230\u5fc3\u9748\uff0c\u5efa\u69cb\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u6587\u5316\u8996\u91ce\u3002\u4ee5\u81fa\u7063\u70ba\u51fa\u767c\u9ede\uff0c\u641c\u5c0b\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5730\u5716\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4eba\u5011\u5fc5\u7136\u99d0\u8db3\u7684\u89d2\u843d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0d\u53ef\u7f3a\u5e2d\u7684\u4eba\u6587\u98a8\u666f\u3002\n", "en": "The main purpose of this course is to enrich the literary taste and the cultural cultivation of our students.

Next still life sketching focuses on the composition. You are encouraged to utilize the composition principle of black, white and gray, and emphasize more on the vividness than the form until you get rid of the habit of passive copying of the objects. Then you move from the previous linear sketching practice into facet sketching and then block sketching. At the end of the semester, you will practice human portrait sketching. Until now you should be able to handle not only the characteristics of the line and proportion, but also the gender, age, charm and expression of the model.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u8a2d\u56db", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1051", "code": "1051"}, {"name": "\u56db\u8a2d\u4e09", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1153", "code": "1153"}, {"name": "\u56db\u8a2d\u4e8c", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1254", "code": "1254"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u9673\u921e\u540c", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=20105", "code": "20105"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["A", "B"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u8a2d\u8a08703", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=325", "code": "325"}], "people": "16", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u4e8c\u4e09\u56db\u5e74\u7d1a\u5408\u958b"}, {"id": "142484", "code": "3833024", "name": {"zh": "\u96fb\u8166\u8f14\u52a9\u9020\u5f62\u8a2d\u8a08(\u4e00)", "en": "Computer-aided modeling design (\u2160)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u8b1b\u6388\u96fb\u8166\u8f14\u52a9\u9020\u578b\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e4b\u7e6a\u5716\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u4ee5Alias\u8edf\u9ad4\u4e4b3D\u66f2\u9762\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u50b3\u63883D surface\u8edf\u9ad4\u4e4b\u7acb\u9ad4\u9020\u578b\u7e6a\u5716\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u7a7a\u9593\u6982\u5ff5\u8207\u7522\u54c1\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e4b\u61c9\u7528\uff0c\u8a13\u7df4\u5b78\u751f\u4ee5\u96fb\u8166\u7e6a\u5716\u9054\u52303D\u9020\u578b\u7e6a\u88fd\u8207\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u8207\u6280\u5de7\u3002\n", "en": "This course introduces the computer aided modeling design\uff0cteach students how to use Alias software building conceptual product models and creating quality surface with a comprehensive set of digital modeling \u3001shape\u3001definition\u3002\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u8a2d\u4e09", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=99&sem=1&code=1153", "code": "1153"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8303\u653f\u63c6", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=11463", "code": "11463"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["5", "6", "7"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u8a2d\u8a08306", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=99&sem=1&code=392", "code": "392"}], "people": "14", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "142485", "code": "3834019", "name": {"zh": "\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u8207\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\uff08\u4e00\uff09", "en": "Reverse Engineering and  Rapid prototyping Practice \uff08\u4e00\uff09"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5f9e\u9ede\u7fa4\u6383\u63cf\u3001\u5efa\u69cb\u66f2\u9762\u3001\u5be6\u9ad4\u3001\u5206\u6790\u8207\u6aa2\u6e2c\u4e26\u8f49\u51faStl\u6a94\u7b49\u9006\u5411\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d41\u7a0b\u5230\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u52a0\u5de5\u539f\u7406\u3001\u7cfb\u7d71\u5206\u985e\u505a\u5be6\u52d9\u4ecb\u7d39\u8207\u88fd\u9020\n", "en": "This subject is arranged to introduce the principles and techniques used in Reverse Engineering (RE).

The curriculum structure starts from 50 basic Japanese pronouncing letters. We wish our students first start with good basic pronunciation, and secondary we will put the basic word pattern as a main framework and combine elementary grammar into the pattern.
