In order to discuss the molecular science, we need the background of modern physics because the atoms consist of molecules. To get insight into the materials, we have to understand the chemical bonding and molecular orbitals because material is a collective mass of molecules. Thus, this course covers the fundamental modern physics, quantum chemistry, and solid state. With all these background knowledge, we will further discuss the material properties, such as electricity and magnetism if time is allowed. \r\nOutline: \r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tIntroduction to Modern Physics: Quantum Theory and Atomic Structure\r\n3.\tChemical Bonds and Molecular Orbital Theory\r\n4.\tIntroduction to Solid State\r\n5.\tCrystals and Amorphous materials\r\n6.\tMetallic Materials\r\n7.\tInorganic Materials\r\n8.\tPolymers\r\n9.\tNanomaterials\r\n", "schedule": "Week 1.\tIntroduction\r\nWeek 2.\tIntroduction to Modern Physics (I): Quantum Theory\r\nWeek 3.\tIntroduction to Modern Physics (II): Quantum Theory\r\nWeek 4.\tIntroduction to Modern Physics (III): Atomic Structure\r\nWeek 5.\tChemical Bonds and Molecular Orbitals(I): Chemical Bonds\r\nWeek 6.\tChemical Bonds and Molecular Orbials(II): Molecular Orbitals\r\nWeek 7.\tChemical Bonds and Molecular Orbials(III): Molecular Orbitals\r\nWeek 8.\tChemical Bonds and Molecular Orbials(IV): Molecular Orbitals\r\nWeek 9.\tIntroduction to Solid State(I): Crystal System\r\nWeek 10.\tIntroduction to Solid State(II): Crystal Bonding\r\nWeek 11.\tCrystals and Amorphous materials\r\nWeek 12.\tMetallic Materials\r\nWeek 13.\tInorganic Materials(I)\r\nWeek 14.\tInorganic Materials(II)\r\nWeek 15.\tPolymers(I)\r\nWeek 16.\tPolymers(II)\r\nWeek 17.\tNanomateris\r\nWeek 18.\tMagnetic Properties of Materials\r\n", "scorePolicy": "(1) \u671f\u4e2d\u8003 : 40%\r\n(2) \u671f\u672b\u8003:  40%\r\n(3) \u5e73\u6642\u6210\u7e3e: 20%\r\n", "materials": "1.
