This semester we will look at the literatures and cultures of 20th century South America through literature, music, film, dance, and historical research.  We will read two Nobel Prize winning authors: Jorge Luis Borges (Argentina) and Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Columbia); along with two other prominent writers: Christina Peri Rossi (Uruguay), and Clarice Lispector (Brazil), and also with the writings on cinema and a film by Raul Ruiz (Chile).  We will also watch two or three additional films (Evita, Hour of the Star, and Tango) whose images and stories capture life in Brazil and Argentina.  We shall listen to the music of the world renowned Astor Piazzolla.  In addition, I will try to arrange for an instructor to teach the class basic tango since that dance is one of Argentina\u2019s highest art forms and is one of its gifts to the world.  Some research into the history, politics, and sociology of the region will be required.", "schedule": "Pt I Magic Realism, Parables, Fables, Fictions: \r\nLuis Borges (Argentina): Fictions and Interviews\r\nGarcia Marquez (Columbia): \u201cA Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\u201d \r\nPeri Rossi (Uruguay): from The Museum of Useless Efforts\r\nRaul Ruiz (Argentina): from Poetics of Cinema; Film: Three Crowns of the Sailor\r\n\r\nPt II Politics:\r\n\tFilm: Evita\r\n\tChe: Film: The True Story of Che Guevara [History Channel Film]\r\n\tResearch: Dictatorship, Marxism, Democracy\r\n\r\nPt.
