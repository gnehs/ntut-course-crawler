For this purpose, we will study Christopher Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus and Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter, focusing especially on the theological issues that play a prominent role in the texts. We will investigate the impact of Calvinism and Puritanism on the people and the religious culture in Renaissance England and colonial New England. The choice of the texts is apt for this course mainly because their stories exemplify a continuity of English and American cultural and religious concerns.\r\n\r\nStudents are required to read the course materials carefully before attending each class and be ready to engage actively in class discussion. Every week, four of the students will each do an oral presentation (10 minutes) on the assigned reading material. In addition, there will be a final exam.", "schedule": "Syllabus\r\n\r\n09/14  Introduction\r\n\r\n09/21  General comments on Christopher Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus (1604; 1616); Doctor Faustus [Prologue, 1.1-1.2]\r\n\r\n09/28  Doctor Faustus [1.3, 1.4. 2.1]\r\n\r\n10/05  Doctor Faustus [2.1; 2.2; 2.3]\r\n\r\n10/12  Doctor Faustus [3 Chorus; 3.1; 3.2]\r\n\r\n10/19  Doctor Faustus [4 Chorus; 4.1]\r\n\r\n10/26  Doctor Faustus [4.2; 5.1]\r\n\r\n11/02  Doctor Faustus [5.2; Epilogue]\r\n\r\n11/09  General Comments on Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter; The Scarlet Letter [The Custom-House]\r\n\r\n11/16  The Scarlet Letter [I.
