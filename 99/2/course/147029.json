As she observes, \u201cShakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\u201d For \u201cphrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\u201d in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. For these reasons, among others, this course aims to guide students to appreciate Shakespeare. It will examine two of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies Hamlet and King Lear in particular and explore the generic elements of Shakespearean tragedies as well. As a dramatic mode, tragedy is a particular way of presenting a particular kind of story. We will discuss the characters inhabiting the two plays, the significant issues in them, and the idea of tragedy exemplified by them. From bloodthirsty revenge, to family struggles, madness, and jealousy, this course provides an opportunity for students to study two of Shakespeare\u2019s most important tragedies in depth.", "schedule": "Syllabus\n02/21  General Introduction \n\n02/28  Holiday\n\n03/07  King Lear \n\n03/14  King Lear\n\n03/21  King Lear\n\n03/28  King Lear\n\n04/04  Holiday\n\n04/11  King Lear\nOral Presentation on King Lear\nStudent 1:   \t\t\tStudent 2:       \t\tStudent 3:   \nStudent 4:   \t\t\tStudent 5:        \tStudent 6:\n\n04/18  King Lear\nOral Presentation on King Lear\nStudent 7:   \t\t\tStudent 8:       \t\tStudent 9:   \nStudent 10:   \t\t\tStudent 11:        \tStudent 12: \n\n04/25  Hamlet\n\n05/02  Hamlet\n\n05/09  Hamlet\n\n05/16  Hamlet\n\n05/23  Hamlet\n\n05/30  Hamlet\nOral Presentation on Hamlet\nStudent 1:   \t\t\tStudent 2:       \t\tStudent 3:   \nStudent 4:   \t\t\tStudent 5:        \tStudent 6:\n\n06/06  Holiday\n\n06/13  Hamlet\nOral Presentation on King Lear\nStudent 7:   \t\t\tStudent 8:       \t\tStudent 9:   \nStudent 10:   \t\t\tStudent 11:        \tStudent 12:\n\n06/20  Review", "scorePolicy": "Grading policy:\nAttendance and class performance: 30%, oral presentation: 30%, position paper: 40%", "materials": "Bibliography\nShakespeare, William.
