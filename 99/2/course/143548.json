The characterization methods will be emphasized on the x-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With such background, students are expected to have the basic capability to read the nanomaterial articles which will be carried on the section of Selected Topic Studies.  \t\r\n\r\nOutline: \r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tPhysical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces\r\n3.\tCharacterization and Properties of Nanomaterials\r\n(1)\tStructural Characterization\r\n(2)\tChemical Characterization\r\n(3)\tPhysical Properties of Nanomaterials\r\n(4)\tElectrical Conductivity\r\n(5)\tFerroelectrics and Dielectrics\r\n(6)\tSuperparamagnetism\r\n4.\tSpecial Nanomaterials\r\n5.\tSelected Topics Studies\r\n", "schedule": "Week 1.\tIntroduction to Nanotechnology\r\nWeek 2.\tIntroduction to Nanotechnology\r\nWeek 3.\tReview Modern Physics\r\nWeek 4.\tReview Atomic and Molecular Orbitals\r\nWeek 5.\tPhysical Chemistry of Solid Surface\r\nWeek 6.\tStructure Characterization by X-ray diffraction\r\nWeek 7.\tStructure Characterization by X-ray diffraction\r\nWeek 8.\tStructure Characterization by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy\r\nWeek 9.\tChemical Characterization\r\nWeek 10.\tPhysical Properties of Nanomaterials\r\nWeek 11.\tElectrical Conductivity\r\nWeek 12.\tFerroelectrics and Dielectrics\r\nWeek 13.\tSuperparamagnetism\r\nWeek 14.\tSpecial Nanomaterials\r\nWeek 15.\tSelected Topics Studies\r\nWeek 16.\tSelected Topics Studies\r\nWeek 17.\tSelected Topics Studies\r\nWeek 18.\tSelected Topics Studies\r\n", "scorePolicy": "\r\n\u671f\u4e2d\u8003: 50 %\r\n\u671f\u672b\u8003: 50 %\r\n", "materials": "1.Guozhong Cao, Nanostructures and Nanomaterials-Synthesis, Properties and Applications, Imperial College Press, London, 2004.\r\n2.C.
