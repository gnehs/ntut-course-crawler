Hence, the subject is also called philosophy of man or philosophical anthropology. This course will be divided into two stages as it proceeds. First, we shall review the insights provided by a famous British philosopher Julian Baggini.  To meet this goal, we shall read his popular book: \"What's It All About? Philosophy and The Meaning of Life.\" We thus are able to understand this subject on a solid footing. Then, by monitoring the major findings in some subjects such as neuroscience, psychology, neurobiology, and physiology, we thus enhance our understanding toward some key issues concerning human beings. These issues include at least: mind, emotions, creativity, body, and faces, and so on. To serve this purpose, we will watch some related scientific films produced by BBC, Discovery, NHK, and the like,to enrich our understanding toward we human beings.", "schedule": "Weeks    Contents of instruction            Text chapter\n1.
