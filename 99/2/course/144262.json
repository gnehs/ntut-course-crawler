Linear Equations\r\n- To understand the basic terminologies and notations of matrices and systems of linear equations, in the forms of vector equation and matrix equation.\r\n- Solving a system of linear equations with the Gaussian elimination: reducing a matrix to its echelon form.\r\n- To interpret a system of linear equations in various ways.\r\n- First exposure to key concepts such as linear independence and linear transformation.\r\n(8) 2. Matrix Algebra\r\n- To learn basic matrix arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication power, transpose, and inverse.\r\n- To summarize the concepts for systems of n linear equations in n unknowns.\r\n(12) 3. Vector Spaces\r\n- Introduction to vector spaces.\r\n- Fundamental subspaces of a matrix: column space, row space, and null space.\r\n- Basis and dimension of a vector space.\r\n(8) 4. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors\r\n- To find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.\r\n- Diagonalization of a matrix (linear transformation).\r\n- To view eigenbases in the context of simplifying (decorrelating) linear transformations.\r\n(8) 5. Orthogonality and Inner-Product Spaces\r\n- To introduce inner product of vectors, and thus the geometric concepts of length, distance, and angle (perpendicularity).\r\n- To be familiar with the use of orthogonal bases.\r\n- Least-Squares approximation.", "scorePolicy": "1.
