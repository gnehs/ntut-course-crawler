Students who fail to submit the dossier as scheduled forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.\n(3)\tEvaluating one\u2019s own presentations: all briefings/presentations have to be videotaped by the student presenter. Student presenters are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own presentations, and compile all evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete electronic portfolio (on compact disc) needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\nGrading Policy: \t(1) Academic honesty is prioritized in this class. Students should learn that plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students will fail the course without contention once an incident of plagiarism is identified in their submitted writing or presented speech.\n(2) The grading components are as follows:\nAttendance 30%   \t\tBriefings/ Presentations  30%\nMeeting Simulations 20%\tFinal Exam (impromptu) 20%", "materials": "N/A", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
