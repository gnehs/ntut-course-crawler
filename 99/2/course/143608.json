Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schrodinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of  physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.", "schedule": "Week 1: Review and Chemical Bonds\r\nWeek 2: Chemical Bonds\r\nWeek 3: MOLECULAR SHAPE AND STRUCTURE\r\nWeek 4: MOLECULAR SHAPE AND STRUCTURE\r\nWeek 5: MOLECULAR SHAPE AND STRUCTURE\r\nWeek 6: THE PROPERTIES OF GASES\r\nWeek 7: THE PROPERTIES OF GASES\r\nWeek 8: LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\r\nWeek 9: LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS\r\nWeek 10: INORGANIC MATERIALS\r\nWeek 11: The Elements: the d-block\r\nWeek 12: Thermodynamics: The First Law\r\nWeek 13: Thermodynamics: The 2nd and 3rd Law\r\nWeek 14: Thermodynamics: The 2nd and 3rd Law\r\nWeek 15: Chemical Equilibria\r\nWeek 16: Electrochemistry \r\nWeek 17: Electrochemistry\r\nWeek 18: Chemical Kinetics", "scorePolicy": "(1) \u671f\u4e2d\u8003 : 40%\r\n(2) \u671f\u672b\u8003:  40%\r\n(3) \u5e73\u6642\u6210\u7e3e: 20%\r\n", "materials": "Textbook : P.
