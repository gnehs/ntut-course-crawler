We first introduce the TCP/IP model and then discuss how the basic tools can be used to create servers, emphasizing practical designs and techniques that are important to programmers. Topics include OSI model, TCP/IP model, Client-Server Model and Software Design, Concurrent Processing in Client-Server Software, Socket API, Client Software Design, Server Software Design, TCP/UDP, Remote Procedure Calls, and new topics related to the Internet.", "schedule": "1 Introduction and Overview (2hrs)\r\n2 OSI Model (3hrs)\r\n3 Client Server Model and Software Design (3hrs)\r\n4 Concurrent Processing in Client-Server Software (2hr)\r\n5 Socket API (5hrs)\r\n6 Client Software Design and Example (6hrs)\r\n7 Server Software Design and Example (15hrs)\r\n8 Tunneling and Application Level Gatways (4hrs)\r\n9 XDR and RPC (8hrs)\r\n10 Presentations on Other Protocols (6hrs)", "scorePolicy": "1.\tQuizzes\t          10%\r\n2.\tLABs\t          50%\r\n3.\tPresentations\t10%\r\n4.\tFinal Exam\t30%\r\n\u2022Each student needs to present an existing protocol about in the end of this semester.\r\n\u2022Quiz will be given without notice.\r\n", "materials": "Textbook:\r\nInternetworking with TCP/IP, Volume 3: Client-Server Programming and Application, Linux-POSIX Sockets Version.
