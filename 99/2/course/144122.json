It also highlights the close relationship between course design and teaching as the teacher builds on knowledge. Students will present and discuss the viewpoints of various practitioners and the professional community. They, therefore, are expected to finish the assigned readings before class and actively participate in class presentations and discussions.", "schedule": "Week 1     Introduction\r\nWeek 2     No Class!\r\nWeek 3     Chapter 1\r\nWeek 4     Chapter 2\r\nWeek 5     Chapter 3\r\nWeek 6     Chapter 4 (Part I)\r\nWeek 7     Chapter 4 (Part II)\r\nWeek 8     Chapter 5 (Parts I & II)\r\nWeek 9     Midterm\r\nWeek 10    Chapter 6 (Part I)\r\nWeek 11    Chapter 6 (Part II)\r\nWeek 12    Chapter 7\r\nWeek 13    Chapter 8 (Part I)\r\nWeek 14    Chapter 8 (Part II)\r\nWeek 15    Chapter 9\r\nWeek 16    No Class!\r\nWeek 17    Chapter 10\r\nWeek 18    Final", "scorePolicy": "Class Attendance: 10%\r\nClass Participation: 30%\r\nMidterm: 30%\r\nFinal: 30%", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
