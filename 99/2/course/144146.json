Anyway all the novels are British (some decidedly so) and all involve marvelous journeys through space and time.  They range in nature from the (inspiredly) silly (Alice\u2019s aforementioned adventures) to the satirical (Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels), from the poignant horror of the Romantic grotesque (Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein) to a Modernist mindscape weaving inner and outer of life and time (Virginia Woolf\u2019s The Waves).  Emphasis will be laid upon going beyond the (often delightful) details of plot to appreciate the nuance woven into the language used by each of these four classic authors.  We will also examine other related (very short) works of literature that shed light upon the principle texts.  It is my hope that we will learn to appreciate the spiritual, aesthetic, political and philosophical usages, demands and delights of literature in general and the novel in particular.", "schedule": "All assignments are due next class session unless otherwise indicated.
