In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5b50\u4e8c\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=852", "code": "852"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u6c6a\u8a69\u73ee", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=22268", "code": "22268"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["3", "4"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559302(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=27", "code": "27"}], "people": "63", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "94037", "code": "1404004", "name": {"zh": "\u4e2d\u570b\u53f2", "en": "The History of China"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u4ee5\u6b77\u53f2\u8da8\u52e2\u7684\u95e1\u8ff0\u53ca\u5c08\u984c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u65b9\u9762\u540c\u6642\u9032\u884c\u3002\u8ab2\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u3001\u897f\u6b77\u53f2\u89c0\u5ff5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u4ee3\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u6f14\u9032\uff0c\u85c9\u4ee5\u5e6b\u52a9\u5b78\u751f\u8a8d\u8b58\u6642\u4ee3\u4e4b\u8da8\u52e2\u8207\u610f\u7fa9\u3002\u6388\u8ab2\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53e3\u982d\u8b1b\u8ff0\u70ba\u4e3b\uff0c\u8a0e\u8ad6\u53ca\u66f8\u9762\u5831\u544a\u70ba\u8f14\uff0c\u671f\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5728\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u5167\uff0c\u80fd\u5c0d\u4e2d\u570b\u6b77\u53f2\u6709\u4e00\u7c21\u8981\u800c\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u5b78\u751f\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u611f\u3002\n", "en": "Methodologically, the course is performed in two ways at the same time: interpretation of historical trends as well as the study and analysis of specific topics.

It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed. Through the internalization, the students might benefit themse\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5b50\u4e00\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=1&code=948", "code": "948"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u95dc\u5c1a\u667a", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=10452", "code": "10452"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["5", "6"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e8c\u6559207(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=1&code=25", "code": "25"}], "people": "49", "peopleWithdraw": "7", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "94068", "code": "1404005", "name": {"zh": "\u61b2\u6cd5\u8207\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e", "en": "Constitutional Principles"}, "description": {"zh": "\u5b6b\u4e2d\u5c71\u5148\u751f\u5275\u7acb\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u4e4b\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e\u5728\u65bc\u4e09\u6c11\u4e3b\u7fa9\u4e4b\u81ea\u7531\u5e73\u7b49\u3001\u6c11\u4e3b\u3001\u5747\u5bcc\uff0c\u6b64\u7cbe\u795e\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4f9d\u64da\u7684\u539f\u5247\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u61b2\u6cd5\u70ba\u7d93\uff0c\u3000\u570b\u7236\u5efa\u570b\u4e4b\u7406\u60f3\u6b65\u9a5f\u70ba\u7def\uff0c\u4ffe\u4f7f\u5b78\u751f\u5145\u5206\u77ad\u89e3\u6211\u570b\u4e4b\u7acb\u570b\u7cbe\u795e\u6240\u5728\uff0c\u4e26\u8a8d\u8b58\u6211\u570b\u61b2\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u5167\u6db5\uff0c\u57f9\u990a\u5b78\u751f\u7dad\u8b77\u61b2\u6cd5\u4e4b\u5c0a\u56b4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u611b\u570b\u5bb6\u611b\u6c11\u65cf\u4e4b\u60c5\u64cd\u3002\n", "en": "The Republic of China is established by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the basis of Equality, Democracy, and Equated Distribution of Wealth, which are also the principles in San-Ming-Zhu-Yi (literally, Three Principles of the People).

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

The Nineteenth Century : The Industrial Revolution was the major influence on architectural history development. Structures of this period were marvels of engineering using materials like iron, plate glass, and reinforced concrete in new types of construction. 2). Foundation of Modernism (1890-1920) : In this period, the art community, including Cubism, Expressionism, De Stijl, Futurism and Constructivism, greatly influenced the form of building.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

A review of grammatical ideas at high level is reinforced by correcting sentence errors, and revising awkward usage of words or sentence structures. The main subjects include English sentence structures, verbal usages, conjunctions, and sequences. Related topics for class discussion cover direct and indirect speech, sentence transformation and modification of sentences; (b) The second half of the course focuses on English rhetoric--principles of effective written and spoken communication. Topics for class discussion include reference, coherence, reverse structures and some related rhetorical concepts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

A review of grammatical ideas at high level is reinforced by correcting sentence errors, and revising awkward usage of words or sentence structures. The main subjects include English sentence structures, verbal usages, conjunctions, and sequences.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.
