In 2002, related government agencies try to pormote the application of EEM , and attempt to adopt this specific measure. However, the lack of basic understanding and knowledge has been the main reason why engineers are struggling in introducing EEM into reality.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

issues such as land use, transportation, and case studies on NIMBY facilities.Furthermore, I will also demonstrate planned unit developments and how to transform a two-dimensional planning into a three-dimensional development.After the midterm, I'll focus on more foresighted and deliberate planning techniques, including ecological community planning methods, disaster-preventive, planning, and the possible coping measures with respect to the impacts resulting from technological advances such as the internet and the mass transit systems. At the end, I'll also cover topics regarding the impacts of globalization and competition upon community developments.As I have had a lot of empirical experiences from my job, the students are allow to specify some topics or issues for this class so that the students\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5efa\u56db", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=2&code=668", "code": "668"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8a31\u620e\u8070", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=21674", "code": "21674"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["3", "4"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [], "people": "15", "peopleWithdraw": "1", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u8a2d\u8a08\u9928251\u6559\u5ba4"}, {"id": "96810", "code": "1001001", "name": {"zh": "\u9ad4\u80b2", "en": "Physical Education"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u6821\u9ad4\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u76ee\u6a19\u70ba\u935b\u934a\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u5fc3\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5168\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u904b\u52d5\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u767c\u63da\u5718\u968a\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u990a\u6210\u7d42\u8eab\u904b\u52d5\u7fd2\u6163\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e00\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u666e\u901a\u73ed\u9ad4\u80b2\u6b63\u8ab2\u6559\u5b78\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u5c08\u9805\u5206\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u7531\u5177\u6709\u5c08\u9577\u4e4b\u6559\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u3002\u958b\u8ab2\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u7c43\u7403\u3001\u6392\u7403\u3001\u684c\u7403\u3001\u7fbd\u7403\u3001\u4fdd\u9f61\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u7bad\u3001\u9ad8\u723e\u592b\u7403\u3001\u7db2\u7403\u3001\u9ad4\u64cd\u904a\u6232\u3001\u6162\u901f\u58d8\u7403\u3001\u592a\u6975\u62f3\u3001\u570b\u969b\u6a19\u6e96\u821e\u3001\u9ad4\u9069\u80fd\u3001\u570b\u8853\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u5f97\u6309\u81ea\u5df1\u8208\u8da3\u9078\u64c7\u4fee\u7fd2\u3002\u672c\u6821\u9ad4\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u76ee\u6a19\u70ba\u935b\u934a\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u5fc3\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5168\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u904b\u52d5\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u767c\u63da\u5718\u968a\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u990a\u6210\u7d42\u8eab\u904b\u52d5\u7fd2\u6163\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e00\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u666e\u901a\u73ed\u9ad4\u80b2\u6b63\u8ab2\u6559\u5b78\u3002\u56db\u6280\u4e8c\u3001\u4e09\u5e74\u7d1a\u5be6\u65bd\u5c08\u9805\u5206\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u7531\u5177\u6709\u5c08\u9577\u4e4b\u6559\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u3002\u958b\u8ab2\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u7c43\u7403\u3001\u6392\u7403\u3001\u684c\u7403\u3001\u7fbd\u7403\u3001\u4fdd\u9f61\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u7bad\u3001\u9ad8\u723e\u592b\u7403\u3001\u7db2\u7403\u3001\u9ad4\u64cd\u904a\u6232\u3001\u6162\u901f\u58d8\u7403\u3001\u592a\u6975\u62f3\u3001\u570b\u969b\u6a19\u6e96\u821e\u3001\u9ad4\u9069\u80fd\u3001\u570b\u8853\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u5f97\u6309\u81ea\u5df1\u8208\u8da3\u9078\u64c7\u4fee\u7fd2\u3002\n", "en": "All students are required to attend two hours per week of Physical Education class.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

When art is used to express feelings, advocate religions, propagandizing politics, or transmitting thoughts, it never needs any reason. Don't say that you don't know what art is! In the 21st century, art is no longer the privilege of wealthy ladies. But you all, the future designers and architects, should work harder to make yourself inseparable with art.

It would be our honor to have them in the campus and share their fruition of art with all of the staff and students.\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "1.0", "hours": "1", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=2&code=1003", "code": "1003"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8a31\u7956\u8c6a", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=11290", "code": "11290"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["5"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u56db\u6559204(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=75", "code": "75"}], "people": "38", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "101004", "code": "8401003", "name": {"zh": "\u7e6a\u756b", "en": "Painting"}, "description": {"zh": "\u7406\u8ad6\uff1a\r\n1.\u7d20\u63cf\u6982\u5ff5\r\n2.\u5f62\u9ad4\u8207\u7a7a\u9593\u8868\u9054\r\n3.\u98a8\u683c\u4ecb\u7d39\r\n\u6280\u6cd5\uff1a\r\n1.\u5617\u8a66\u591a\u5143\u5a92\u9ad4\u8868\u73fe\r\n2.\u7df4\u7fd2\u5fc3\u7dd2\u8868\u9054\r\n3.\u7269\u9ad4\u6479\u5beb\r\n\u5275\u4f5c\u8207\u9451\u8cde\uff1a\r\n1.\u7d20\u63cf\u7684\u98a8\u683c\u8207\u8868\u9054\r\n2.\u7d20\u63cf\u5275\u4f5c\r\n\u53c3\u8a2a\u8207\u89c0\u6469\n", "en": "Theories\uff1a\r\n1.Concepts of sketch\r\n2.Expressions of structure and space\r\n3.Introduction of styles\r\nTechniques\uff1a\r\n1.Try expressing of multiple\r\n2.Practice expressing from the state of mind\r\n3.Sketch some objects\r\nCreation and Appreciation\uff1a\r\n1.Styles and expressions of sketch\r\n2.Sketch creation\r\nVisit to art museum\n"}, "stage": "2", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u25b2", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5275\u610f\u4e00", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=95&sem=2&code=1003", "code": "1003"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8881\u91d1\u5854", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=22232", "code": "22232"}, {"name": "\u9673\u5764\u5fb7", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=22229", "code": "22229"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": ["5", "6", "7"], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u56db\u6559204(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=95&sem=2&code=75", "code": "75"}], "people": "41", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "101005", "code": "8401004", "name": {"zh": "\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u8a0e", "en": "Senior Project(II)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u900f\u904e\u8a2d\u8a08\u5c08\u984c\u7684\u6f14\u7df4\uff0c\u767c\u5c55\u5b78\u751f\u6574\u9ad4\u7684\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5275\u65b0\u8a2d\u8a08\u5c08\u696d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4ee5\u8a2d\u8a08\u7814\u7a76\u70ba\u57fa\u790e\uff0c\u91dd\u5c0d\u5b78\u751f\u500b\u5225\u8208\u8da3\u5c08\u9577\u9078\u5b9a\u5c08\u984c\uff0c\u9032\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u767c\u5c55\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u6f14\u7df4\u65b0\u7522\u54c1\u958b\u767c\u4e4b\u904e\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u57f9\u990a\u5de5\u696d\u8a2d\u8a08\u4e4b\u5c08\u696d\u3002\n", "en": "This course aims to a thesis project within the practices areas of industrial design, chosen by the student in consultation with the program instructors.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill. As a response to this concern, a new discipline, engineering ethics, is emerging for undergraduate engineering courses.
