All reading passages, exercises, and writing tasks focus on these two levels while presenting a variety of rhetorical modes and grammatical supports.\r\nThe teacher's instruction focuses on familiarizing students with sentence skills, paragraph organizations, and evaluating their writings. Students need to preview reading selections and are encouraged to communicate their ideas at class. The weekly writing assignments help them master the essential grammar necessary for well-formed sentences and require them to use the specific rhetorical mode to develop their paragraphs.", "schedule": "1.
