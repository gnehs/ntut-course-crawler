In this course, we will discuss how to apply the computer to assist the molecular structure design. In order to gain insight into the basic idea of structural designed, the fundamental background in molecular mechanics and quantum chemistry will be introduced. A practical software introduction will also be included in the course.\r\n\r\nOutline: \r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tIntroduction to Molecular Mechanics\r\n3.\tIntroduction to Quantum Chemistry Calculation \r\n4.\tProperties Analysis\r\n5.\tOptimization Techniques\r\n6.\tMolecular Dynamics", "schedule": "Week 1.\tIntroduction to computational chemistry\r\nWeek 2.\tReview fundamental theories: classical mechanics and quantum mechanics\r\nWeek 3.\tForce Field Methods (I)\r\nWeek 4.\tForce Field Methods (I)\r\nWeek 5.\tElectronic Structure Methods (I) \r\nWeek 6.\tElectronic Structure Methods (II)\r\nWeek 7.\tElectronic Structure Methods (III)\r\nWeek 8.\tElectronic Structure Methods (IV)\r\nWeek 9.\tDensity Functional Methods (I)\r\nWeek 10.\tDensity Functional Methods (II)\r\nWeek 11.\tDensity Functional Methods (III)\r\nWeek 12.\tWave Function Analysis (I)\r\nWeek 13.\tWave Function Analysis (II)\r\nWeek 14.\tIllustrating the Concepts (I)\r\nWeek 15.\tIllustration the Concepts (II)\r\nWeek 16.\tOptimization Techniques \r\nWeek 17.\tSimulation Techniques (I)\r\nWeek 18.\tSimulation Techniques (II)", "scorePolicy": "(1) \u671f\u4e2d: 30%\r\n(2) \u671f\u672b: 30%\r\n(3) \u5e73\u6642: 40%", "materials": "1.\tFrank Jensen, Introduction to Computational Chemistry, 2nd, 2007, John Wiley and Sons.\r\n2.\tTim Clark, A Handbook of Computational Chemistry, 1985, John Wiley and Sons.\r\n3.\tIra N.
