The focus of our study will be upon those situations in which two or more cultures interact with one another\u2014linguistically, artistically, politically, militarily and/or spiritually.  We will study texts and films underscoring the problematics of cross-cultural interactions as have emerged from colonial and post-colonial social structures.  Our course materials will particularly focus on aboriginal, Caribbean, African-American and Latino cultures, but you will have a chance to make cross-cultural comparisons of other cultures in which you may have a particular interest in papers and oral presentations.", "scorePolicy": "GRADING\r\n\r\n25%\tMidterm Paper \t\t\t25%\tPresentation\r\n25%\tFinal Paper\t\t\t25%\tParticipation & Journals", "materials": "TEXTS\r\n\r\nCourse Reader (Containing articles by Julio Finn, Frank Kofsky and Paul Garon; \u201cThe Blackamoor of Peter the Great\u201d by Alexander Pushkin; selected American folk ballads; poetry by Bob Kaufman, Amiri Baraka and Ntzake Shange; and song lyrics by Jimmy Cliff.)\r\n\r\nBlake Elk Speaks: Being the Life of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux as told through John G.
