In this course, students can expect to establish solid theoretical and practical backgrounds needed to build a computer system from scratch. Besides the textbook, we also include most recent research results so that students can keep up with the latest trend with industry. Please note that a considerable portion of the course materials and lectures will be given in English.", "schedule": "1. Introduction (1): fundamental Boolean logic\r\n2.
