The purpose to write something suggested by the source texts, which can be responded to on a formal or thematic or associative level.  Of course anything quoted from a source text must be placed in quotation marks, and anything inspired by another work  should show obeisance to that original source, .  In some way, the opriginal source must be honored.  In the case of a formal college-level essay this will involve application of the MLA system.  With a creative work maybe it would be more appropriate to mention the source text by name on in another way to acknowledge its authorship.   It is my hope that this class might erase, however temporarily, writing as a set of unquestioning and unquestionable rules.  There are conventions of course, of grammar, syntax and clarity, although these vary slightly from genre to genre.  It is also possible that \u201cmistakes\u201d may be our friends as we witness the meaning of writing forming itself before our very eyes.  Our mode should be one of inquiry, not imputation, and this inquiry should carry as well back into their writing process.  Rather than directly analyzing primary, original source texts we will use them as jumping off points for further writing.  Students are then encouraged to enter into dialogue with the great writers and thinkers of all time, not as master to pupil, but as writer to writer, human being to human being.", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
