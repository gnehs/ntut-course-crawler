During this writing course, you are expected to acquire 13 writing skills for business. Not only do you need to know the structure of each strategy, but you have to know how to use it during the lecture. This is a practical course; you, therefore, should hand in an assignment after each class. Also, the midterm and final will be assessed by one of the strategies we will have gone through by then.
