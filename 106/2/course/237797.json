The use of any form of recording device and/or photographing is strictly prohibited. \r\n(2)\tStudents are divided into 8-10 groups to prepare study guide and produce chapter presentations. All materials need to be uploaded to the designated online platform and available for all students enrolled. \r\ni.\tEach group is responsible for preparing handouts with detailed annotations by standard format. Such annotated notes will be the primary study / analysis guide for in-class discussions. Upload TWO weeks prior to the scheduled class session. \r\nii.\tA full-length presentation MUST be recorded and completed in the studio at least TWO weeks prior to the in-class discussion (presentation & Q&A). Submit on the day of presentation.\r\niii.\tAll the aforementioned materials need to submitted a week before the final exam. \r\n(3)\tEach student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.  \r\n(4)\tThe instructor will not assign additional readings. However, as SLA is multi-disciplinary in nature, it comprises a broad array of theories and studies. Students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings.\r\n(5)\tAttendance: Students are required to attend class as scheduled. \r\ni.\tEach unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction. \r\nii.\tAt the sole discretion of the instructor, absence penalty may be waived with valid proof and just cause. Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. It is important to know that generally only ONE- time penalty waiver will be considered.  \r\niii.\tLateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Each occasions of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.\r\nEvaluation Procedures & Grading System:\r\n\tFinal grades will be determined by a point system (X out of 100 total points). Students will be evaluated by their presentations, handouts, full-length text translations, in-class exams, and attendance. (Adjustments will be made if necessary.) \r\n(1)\tPPT Presentation /Study Guide (annotated notes) 20%\r\n(2)\tExams (Midterm & Final) 50-60% \r\n(3)\tAttendance 20-30%", "materials": "Selected Chapters from Understanding Second Language Acquisition (Ellis) 1st and 2nd editions", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
