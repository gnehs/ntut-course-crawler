Moreover, this class is to provide the students with experience in modeling the theory and applications for optical system design, using commonly used software tools such as MATLAB\u00ae and COMSOL. Student will also learn more system design such as the solar dish receiver and laser system from professional specialist faculties from Pitotech.", "schedule": "1st week\uff1aOpening and Meeting\r\n2nd week\uff1aRay Propagation in an Inhomogeneous Medium\r\n3rd week\uff1aRay optics by ABCD matrix (MATLA&COMSOL) \r\n4th week\uff1aAberrations\r\n5th-6th week\uff1aSolar dish receiver (by Pitotech)\r\n7th week\uff1aWave Optics and Maxwell's Equations\r\n8th week\uff1aGaussian Beam Optics (MATLAB&COMSOL)\r\n9th ~10th week: Midterm Exam (COMSOL)\r\n11th~12th week\uff1aLaser system (by Pitotech)\r\n13th~14th week\uff1aFinal project preparation\r\n15th -16th week\uff1aFinal project presentation", "scorePolicy": "Midterm presentation 25%\r\nFinal project presentation 25%\r\nHomework: 30%\r\nProgramming Quiz: 20%", "materials": "Optics (4th Edition)  by Eugene Hecht", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
