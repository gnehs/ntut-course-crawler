Must what is popular be good?", "schedule": "Week \t1: \tIntroduction\r\n\t\r\n\t2-7:\tUnit 1\t\r\n\r\n        8-12:\tUnit 2\r\n\r\n        13-17:  Unit 3\r\n\t\r\n\t18:\tFinals week", "scorePolicy": "Grades:\r\n\tMidterm  50%\r\n\tFinal\t50%\r\n\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 4 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n\r\nWeekly response pages:  each missing/late paper  =  -10 points from course grade", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
