The main topics of this course include models that are widely used in various fields to describe data and indices, plots for exploring characteristics and patterns of data, and estimation and prediction based on the data models. In addition, we will discuss how to generate random sample from several probability distributions and how to solve optimization problems frequently encountered in several areas.
