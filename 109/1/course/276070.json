Concepts beyond the classical description will be introduced, such as the semi-classical hydrogen model of Bohr, the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation, and an introduction to applied technology. A major focus will be the modern attention of physics to medical device and technology. This course will utilize mathematical concepts from linear algebra and calculus.", "schedule": "Week of \tTopics\tDetails\tProblem Sets\r\nSept. 14\tFundamental Concepts \u2013 Constants and how they
