In order to receive credit for this course, you must complete all assignments.\r\n\u2022\tAll assignments are due in hard copy at the beginning of class. (You will have technology problems. Make sure to print your paper early enough that you will not run into difficulties with non-functioning printers.) For formal papers (e.g. your proposal and annotated bibliography) I take off 5% if you are late to class on a paper due date (10% if you are fifteen or more minutes late), 10% if the paper is turned in within twenty-four hours after the due date (before 1:00 p.m. on Thursday) and 20% if the paper is turned in within forty-eight hours of the deadline. You will not receive any credit for a paper turned in more than 48 hours late. Any late paper should be turned in both by an e-mail Word document and in an identical hard copy. I hope that you will turn in all papers on time, but in the event that a paper is late, bring it to my office. If I am not in my office, slip the paper under the door or put it my box. Please also immediately send me an e-mail alerting me that you have left a paper for me. If you wish to receive credit for a late paper, it is your responsibility to make sure that the paper gets to me safely. \r\n\u2022\tAs this class is more assignment-based than others that I teach, I will give 50% credit for late assignments turned in within 24 hours. No credit is given for later homework. If you know you will be absent, get me the assignment ahead of time.\r\n\u2022\tOn your many quizzes, you may use the handwritten notes you have taken in your reading notebook so long as these notes are a result of your individual effort on the reading and have not been borrowed from or shared with other students (which is scholastic dishonesty). \r\n\r\nGrade Percentages:\r\nPresentations: 20%\r\nQuizzes: 20%\r\nAssignments: 25%\r\nProposal and Annotated Bibliography: 25%\r\nParticipation: 10%\r\n\r\nAs you know, your course grade in this half of the course will be averaged with your course grade in the other half of the course. Please make sure to follow both professors\u2019 rules on attendance, and try to get a high grade in this half of the course in order to balance out any low scores you might get (due to unforeseen circumstances) in the other. \r\n\r\nMost common reason students fail this course: Plagiarism/Patchwriting. Make sure you absolutely understand how to cite others' work ethically: being able to do so is the main goal of this course.", "materials": "\u2022\tBullock, Richard, et al., editors.
