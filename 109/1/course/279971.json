The more you speak, the more you will learn, and the better you will do in the class (provided that you are also attentive to those around you and allow them a place to jump into the conversation). We will do many small and large group activities to facilitate conversation. \r\n\r\nThis is an English conversation class. In order to get a grade of a 75% or higher, you must speak exclusively in English in this class. (Failure to speak exclusively in English will automatically lower your grade to a 75%, and it may be even lower based on your performance in other areas. You will receive three grace cards for minor slip-ups.) Please speak only English from the moment you walk in the classroom door. Greet your classmates in English. Say goodbye in English. Make plans to work on your group presentations in English. Only by constantly speaking English will you find the holes in your vocabulary and reach fluency.", "schedule": "TBA\r\nReadings will be assigned each week, along with reading and vocabulary quizzes, and class presentations.", "scorePolicy": "30%\tPresentations (graded on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, creativity, and effort)\r\n30%\tReading and Vocabulary Quizzes\r\n25%\tParticipation & English spoken (in student-led discussions, whole-class activities, etc.) \r\n15%\tFinal Oral Exam/Improvisation", "materials": "Selected Podcasts / Radio Shows\r\nCopied Readings and Course Handouts\r\nStudent-selected texts", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
