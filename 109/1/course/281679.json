In the process of specific topic creation and realization, students will proactively learn critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. Instructors cultivate the active engagement of students in problem solving, without actually participating in it. In this course, students are required to draw up self-learning plans based on their own interests and capabilities and then submit their plans to the departmental office for approval by the beginning of the semester.", "schedule": "\u7b2c1\u9031 Structures and Isomers - History\r\n\u7b2c2\u9031Structures and Isomers - Nomenclature\r\n\u7b2c3\u9031 Structures and Isomers - Isomerism\r\n\u7b2c4\u9031 Structures and Isomers - Coordination Numbers and Structures & Coordination Frameworks\r\n\u7b2c5\u9031 Bonding - Experiment Evidence for Electronic Structure\r\n\u7b2c6\u9031 Bonding - Theories of Electronic Structure\r\n\u7b2c7\u9031 Bonding - Ligand Field Theory & Angular Overlap\r\n\u7b2c8\u9031 Bonding - The Jahn-Teller Effect & Four and Six Coordination Preferences\r\n\u7b2c9\u9031 Electronic Spectra - Absorption of Light\r\n\u7b2c10\u9031 Electronic Spectra - Quantum Numbers of Multielectron Atoms\r\n\u7b2c11\u9031 Electronic Spectra - Electronic Spectra or Coordination Compounds\r\n\u7b2c12\u9031 Electronic Spectra - Electronic Spectra or Coordination Compounds\r\n\u7b2c13\u9031 Reactions and Mechanisms - Background & Substitution Reactions\r\n\u7b2c14\u9031 Reactions and Mechanisms - Kinetic Consequences of Reaction Pathways &\u3000Experimental Evidence in Octahedral Substitution \r\n\u7b2c15\u9031 Reactions and Mechanisms - Stereochemistry of Reaction & Substitution Reactions of Square Planar Complex\r\n\u7b2c16\u9031 Reactions and Mechanisms - The Trans Effect & Oxidation Reduction Reactions\r\n\u7b2c17\u9031 Reactions and Mechanisms - Reaction of Coordinated Ligands\r\n\u7b2c18\u9031 Prepare for Final Report", "scorePolicy": "General (20%)\r\nMidterm(40%)\r\nFinal Exam (40%)", "materials": "Gary L.
