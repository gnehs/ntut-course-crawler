The theme of this course is to encourage students to participate in the discovery of laws and wonder of nature. And to solidate the foundation for the particular courses of study for different departments. The contents of this course include mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, optics, and foundation of modern physics, etc.. The lecturers will design this course under deliberating the differences of each departments to emphasize or to omit some contents. The course is designed for 6 credits for two semesters; 3 credits for each semester,  and 3 lecture hours per week.", "schedule": "Physics and Measurement (1 week)\r\nMotion in One Dimension (1 week) \r\nVectors (1 week)\r\nMotion in Two Dimensions (1 week)\r\nThe Law of Motion (1 week)\r\nCircular Motion & Applications of Newton\u2019s Laws (1 week)\r\nEnergy of a System (2 weeks)\r\nMidterm\r\nLinear Momentum and Collisions (2 weeks)\r\nRotation of a Rigid Object (2 weeks)\r\nAngular Momentum (1 week)\r\nOscillatory Motion (2 weeks)\r\nFinal", "scorePolicy": "Homework: 15%\r\nMidterm: 30%\r\nFinal: 40%\r\nOthers: 15%", "materials": "Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics / A.
