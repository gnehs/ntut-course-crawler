Analytical chemists use a range of methodologies to separate, identify and determine the relative quantity of components with the aim of establishing the make-up of a chemical substance. We will cover a range of methodologies such as chromatography, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis, all of which are fundamental to the modern analytical chemist.", "schedule": "1.
