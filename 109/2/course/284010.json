FINAL PORTFOLIO/PROJECT GRADES - 60% of semester grade.\r\nEvaluating art work always presents certain subjective difficulties. Seeking attention in class, consultations during office hours and critiques are a student\u2019s opportunities to have an ongoing dialogue regarding the artistic merits of their work. For grading purposes, the final judge of aesthetic value must be the instructor. However, students should never underestimate the influence and value of their own input in this process. Healthy debate, constructive criticism and an ongoing exchange of ideas is not only welcome, but should be expected on the parts of both student and teacher. The following criteria are considered in the grading of all work:\r\n1. Demonstration of a working process utilizing techniques covered in class.\r\n2. Level of involvement in the process.\r\n3. Strength of design (includes presentation/craftsmanship).\r\n4. Response to and use of critical suggestions in an effective manner.\r\n5. Adherence to assigned parameters.\r\n6. Artistic merit.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Grades on all drawings are advisory in nature. Students are given the opportunity to rework any and/or all drawings for resubmission the week prior to the final critique. At this time all resubmitted work will be re-evaluated for a permanent grade. This policy allows students the opportunity to rework previously graded drawings in order to maximize their final grade. Advisory grades on all work not resubmitted the week prior to the final critique will become permanent at that time. This opportunity does not apply to drawings which were not submitted for their original deadline (i.e., a work not submitted on its initial due date will not be accepted anytime thereafter and will receive zero (0) points.).\r\n\r\nB. SKETCHBOOK/JOURNAL - 20% of semester grade.\r\n\r\nC. LEARING ATTITUDE/PARTICIPATION - 20% of semester grade.\r\nTo avoid all bias, class participation is a completely numerical calculation based on indicators of performance appropriate to a pre-professional course of study.
