Students will be guided to write in response to readings, pictures, events in their daily lives, and discussions from the class.  Thought-provoking topics dealing with current issues are used to stimulate and foster critical writing strategies. This course enables students to write and discuss logically and clearly; they also need to incorporate grammatically newly-built vocabulary into their writing.", "schedule": "Students will read readings related to writing and write a resume and cover letter, a five-page literary analysis with secondary sources (in preparation for their senior project), and a reflection paper to help them consolidate all the information they have learned. \r\n\r\nStudents will build on the skills they have learned in the first semester and should keep their course packet from the first semester (or print out f the first semester course packet if they were not then a part of the class.)", "scorePolicy": "Literary Analysis: 25%\r\nOther Papers: 40%\r\nHomework, quizzes, and informal writing: 20%\r\nPeer Reviews and Participation: 10%\r\nPresentation: 5%", "materials": "Course packet\r\nTexts for the literary analysis", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
