The major programming language focused will be C++, one of the \"big 3\" programming languages according to the TIOBE survey in Dec. 2017. We shall also cover essential data structures, e.g., linked list and binary search trees, modern development tools, e.g., Make, Subversion, Git, and unit testing tools, object-oriented programing paradigms, design patterns, and refactoring. How to plan a real-world-level project shall also be discussed. From this course, students can expect to be equipped with essential know-hows for computer programming and object-oriented programming, both of which are indispensable in the foreseeable future.", "schedule": "Week 1.
