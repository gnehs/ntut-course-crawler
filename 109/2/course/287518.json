In this course, we will illustrate the fundamental knowledge about crystal lattice, symmetry, atomic scattering, structure factor, and structure determination. In addition, the course also includes practices in structure determination by single crystal x-ray diffraction and powder x-ray diffraction. All fundamental knowledge and practices are mainly in small molecular cases, but part of knowledge of protein crystallography will also be included.", "schedule": "1. Introduction to X-ray \r\n2.
