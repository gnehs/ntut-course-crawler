Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity. As she observes, \"Shakespeare is part and parcel of English-speaking culture, and not only high culture.\" For \"phrases from the plays are still current, woven into the fabric of everyday life\" in Britain now and have, in fact, been circulated in the world since the early modern era. Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers. For these important reasons, this course aims to guide students to appreciate Shakespeare by focusing on a number of his plays.", "schedule": "02/23  General Introduction \r\n\r\n03/02  All\u2019s Well That Ends Well \r\n\r\n03/09  All\u2019s Well That Ends Well\r\n\r\n03/16  All\u2019s Well That Ends Well\r\n\r\n03/23  All\u2019s Well That Ends Well\r\n\r\n03/30  All\u2019s Well That Ends Well\r\nOral Presentation on All\u2019s Well That Ends Well\r\n\r\n04/06  No class\r\n\r\n04/13  The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n04/20  The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n04/27  The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n05/11  The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n05/18  The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n05/25  The Merchant of Venice -- The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\nOral Presentation on The Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n06/01  The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\n\r\n06/02  The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\n\r\n06/08  The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\n\r\n06/15  The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\n\r\n06/22  The Winter\u2019s Tale\r\nOral Presentation on The Winter\u2019s Tale", "scorePolicy": "Attendance and Quizzes: 20%; oral presentation: 30%; position paper: 50%", "materials": "Shakespeare, William.
