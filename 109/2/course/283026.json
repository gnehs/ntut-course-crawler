Practical case studies in the design of optical components and systems will help students become an optical consultant who has the ability to solve problems, especially for wave optics.\r\nStudents will learn commercial optical software Rsoft and COMSOL, which are commonly used in the industry, to simulate the assigned cases studies for modern optics including optical communication, photosensitive materials, and nano-optical structures.\r\nFinally, students are required to autonomy to design, plan, execute, analyze and implement their research ideas to others. There are two ways to presenting their final research results: poster presentations or oral presentations.", "schedule": "2/18 Opening week: introduction to the modern optics \r\n2/25  industrial case studies from Cybernet(\u601d\u6e24\u79d1\u6280) lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \r\n3/4  Case study and group discussion for the case studies raised from Cybernet Co. \r\n3/11 Industrial case studies from PitoTech(\u76ae\u6258\u79d1\u6280) lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\r\n3/18 Case study and group discussion for the case studies raised from PitoTech Co. \r\n3/25\tSimulation exercise\r\n4/1\tMetalens tutorials\tlectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \r\n4/8\tMetalens tutorials II lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Mr. Richard \r\n4/15 Midterm report I\r\n4/22 Midterm report II\r\n4/29 Nonlinear Metalens\t lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\r\n5/6\t Nonlinear response for Au-coated LCE lectured by the invited industrial teacher: Dr. Jason Lin\r\n5/13\tCase study and group discussion With Dr. Jason Lin\r\n5/20\tCase study and group discussion With Prof. Yu-Chieh Cheng\r\n5/27\tCase study and group discussion With Prof. Yu-Chieh Cheng\r\n6/3\t        Case study and group discussion With Mr. Richard\r\n6/10\tCase study and group discussion With Dr. Jason Lin\r\n6/17\tFinal presentations", "scorePolicy": "Exercise and discussion in class 20%\r\nFinal presentation 50%\r\nHomework 30%", "materials": "Optics Hetch", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
