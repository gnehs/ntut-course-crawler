The instructor intends to center on twelve writers this semester, with the foci on the relationships between the genders in the first eight weeks, and human nature after the midterm exam. Through oral presentations and class discussion, students will have a broader view of how literature is on some level a reflection of \u201chuman\u201d life and have the capability to interpret literary works.", "schedule": "1\tOrientation\r\n2\tD.H.
