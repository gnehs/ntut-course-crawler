However, many developers only take Python as a script language instead of using Python\u2019s object oriented characteristics. This class will mainly start from programming Python by the object-oriented way. Students will be required to implement various kinds of assignments to learn the characteristics of Python objects. Besides, students can learn how to apply all kinds of Python application programming interfaces to understand the Python more. In the end of this class, students will be required to develop a network application containing a frond-end client and back-end server to show their achievements.", "schedule": "week 1: introduction and pre-test\r\nweek 2: Input/output\r\nweek 3: Decision structure\r\nweek 4: Repetition structure\r\nweek 5: Files and exceptions\r\nweek 6: Lists\r\nweek 7: Strings\r\nweek 8: Dictionary\r\nweek 9: regular expression\r\nweek 10: Class and object oriented programming\r\nweek 11: Socket and thread\r\nweek 12: Sqlite\r\nweek 13: Callback and observer\r\nweek 14: Web backend\r\nweek 15: Pyqt5\r\nweek 16: Pyqt5\r\nweek 17: Crawler\r\nweek 18: Crawler", "scorePolicy": "On site assignment: 100%", "materials": "Starting Out with Python, 4/e, Tony Gaddis", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
