Particularly, it is central to our fundamental understanding of many science-related fields. This course will introduce students to discuss about several topics in chemistry. All the studying issues are listed and classified into two parts, which are applied in two semesters courses. The first part is described as following, such as chemical foundations, atoms, molecules, and ions, stoichiometry, types of chemical reactions and solution stoichiometry, gases, thermochemistry, atomic structures and periodicity, bonding: general concepts, covalent bonding. Secondarily, all chapters are discussed in the second semester, including liquids and solids, properties of solutions, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, acid-base equilibria, solubility and complex-ion equilibria, spontaneity, entropy, and free energy, electrochemistry. The learning goals are how to  establish students well fundamental concepts in chemistry.\r\n\r\n\u5316\u5b78\u662f\u5b78\u7fd2\u7269\u8cea\u3001\u6027\u8cea\u53ca\u5b83\u7684\u8b8a\u5316\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5b83\u662f\u95dc\u4fc2\u6211\u5011\u53bb\u4e86\u89e3\u5f88\u591a\u76f8\u95dc\u79d1\u5b78\u9818\u57df\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u57fa\u790e\u5b78\u554f\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5b78\u7fd2\u7684\u4e3b\u984c\u5206\u6210\u5169\u5b78\u671f\u4e88\u4ee5\u6559\u5c0e\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u4efd\u4ecb\u7d39\u5316\u5b78\u57fa\u672c\u89c0\u5ff5\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u3001\u96e2\u5b50\uff0c\u8a08\u91cf\u5316\u5b78\uff0c\u5316\u5b78\u53cd\u61c9\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ca\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u8a08\u91cf\uff0c\u6c23\u9ad4\uff0c\u71b1\u5316\u5b78\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u7d50\u69cb\u8207\u9031\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u9375\u7d50\u89c0\u5ff5\uff0c\u5171\u50f9\u9375\u3002\u65bc\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b78\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ecb\u7d39\u6db2\u9ad4\u53ca\u56fa\u9ad4\uff0c\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e4b\u7269\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5316\u5b78\u52d5\u529b\u5b78\uff0c\u5316\u5b78\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9178\u53ca\u9e7c\uff0c\u9178\u53ca\u9e7c\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6eb6\u89e3\u5ea6\u53ca\u932f\u5408\u7269\u4e4b\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u81ea\u767c\u53cd\u61c9\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff0c\u96fb\u5316\u5b78\u3002\u6240\u6709\u5b78\u7fd2\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u4e43\u8b93\u5b78\u751f\u5011\u80fd\u5920\u5960\u4e0b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u790e\u5316\u5b78\u4e4b\u5b78\u8b58\u3002", "schedule": "10.
