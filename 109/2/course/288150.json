College students should have basic knowledge of the life sciences. There are all kinds of living things on the earth we live in, each consisting of basic life units-the cells, which evolve into various organisms to form diverse biological species. Human beings appear to be \u201cadvanced\u201d in some way; however, we share many similarities to other creatures, including cell structures, biochemical and physiological pathways, nutrient acquiring processes, disease production manner, etc. Studying the science of life help us to learn how to make a better way to live on, for example, diagnosis and treatment of diseases, drug invention. Another important point is, we must respect other species as the earth is shared by everyone.\r\n107-2 Study goal \u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u5b78\u7fd2\u76ee\u6a19\r\n1.
