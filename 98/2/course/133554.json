We shall read part of a novel (the very first modern novel in fact), a screenplay, short stories, and some modern poetry.\r\nWe will examine each work for its creativity and its cultural and historical significance.  We will proceed slowly in order to understand the language and figures of speech each writer employs.  We will discuss the setting, theme, character, tone, and atmosphere of each work.  In short we will learn how to read a variety of modern literary texts from both aesthetic and historical perspectives.\r\nEach student must take two exams and write two papers of 4-6 pages each in roughly MLA style (as I shall instruct) selecting to answer one question from a set of questions.  For example: the week that we finish with Don Quixote I will hand out a set of questions about the novel.  Students then elect to write a 4-6 page paper due the following week by the end of class time OR take the exam that same following week.  In short; suppose week 7 we finish Don Quixote, and I hand out writing questions.  Week 8 the student either hands in a paper if he or she wishes, or takes the exam if he or she prefers.  Each student will twice take an exam and twice hand in a paper\r\n", "schedule": "Part I: The Novel\r\n\r\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote, Part One: Prologue, chapters I - VIII; and Part Two: chapter X\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II: The Short Story\r\nFranz Kafka:  \u201cBefore the Law\u201d, \u201cThe Burrow\u201d, \u201cJosephine the Mouse Singer\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III: The Screenplay\r\n\r\nMarguerite Duras:  Hiroshima Mon Amour\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV: Poetry\r\n\r\nArthur Rimbaud:  Selected Poetry and Prose\r\nWislawa Szymborska:\t  View with a Grain of Sand\r\n(And others to be decided\u2026)\r\n", "scorePolicy": "\u3000", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
