The instructor will check students\u2019 notes and homework at irregular intervals. If a student is found to not have taken notes or done homework, 20 points will be deducted from his or her quiz that week.\r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8003\u548c\u88dc\u8003) Weekly quizzes are always administered at the beginning of the class. Late students can ask for a make-up quiz administered by the teaching assistant, but 20 points will be automatically deducted. An absent student, with or without a justifiable reason, cannot ask for a make-up quiz. Yet, for all students, one lowest quiz grade needs not to be factored into the average calculation.\r\n\r\n(\u4f5c\u6587) Students are required to write a composition of 250 words on any chosen topic. It can be submitted any time during the semester but no later than May 28th, 2010. Otherwise, it will be given a zero automatically.\r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8001\u5e2b) Teaching assistant will be awarded 3 bonus points to his or her final grade.\r\n\r\n(\u4f5c\u5f0a\u53ca\u6284\u8972) Any student caught cheating or plagiarizing in a quiz, exam, or composition will be given a zero for his or her final grade without any room of negotiation.\r\n", "materials": "Interactions 1\u2014Reading / Writing (by J.
