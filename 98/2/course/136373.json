Project I involves a writing of analysis on educational or social issues.  Students will be guided with strategies of critical reading and structures of analysis and formal critique so as to set forth thoughtful responses and formulate a coherent thesis and support it with evidences and arguments. Project II\u2014Reading the News\u2014emphasizes analysis and argumentation.  After carefully examining two newspaper articles describing the similar event or issue, students will learn to read critically and write their own analysis and viewpoints.", "schedule": "2/25\tEnumeration; The Old Days\r\n3/4\tAnalysis;\t\u201cTypical Science Fiction Film\u201d\r\n3/11\tWriting an outline\t\u201cWhy Women Should Not Have an Abortion\u201d\r\n3/18\tOrganization of an Argumentative Essay;\t\u201cUniforms\u201d\r\n3/25\tDebatable Statements;\u201cCollege is a Waste of Time and Money\u201d\r\n4/1\tTransitional Words\tResponse to \u201cCollege is a Waste of Time and Money\u201d\r\n4/8\tTOEFL & GRE argumentative sample essays\r\n4/15\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n4/22\tTOEFL & GRE argumentative sample essays;\r\n4/29\tComparison and Contrast;\u201cRomance is a Poor Basis for Marriage\u201d\u201cMy Part-time Jobs\u201d;\u201cMETU and Bogazici University\u201d;\u201cThe Committer vs. the Non-Committer\u201d\r\n5/6\tBrowsing through the news;\u201cThe Noose Incident\u201d\r\n5/13\tSelecting a news event;\u201cAn Appropriate Expression?\u201d\r\n5/20\tComparing and Contrasting Media (Re)Presentations;\t\u201cIthacan Inquirer\u201d\r\n5/27\tArguing Your Point of View\t;\u201cNow Hip-Hop, Too, Is Made in China\u201d\u201cWhy Isn\u2019t Hip-Hop Popular in China\u201d\r\n6/4\tArguing vs. Expressing Your Opinion\r\n6/11\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n6/18     Project II completed\r\n6/25\tReview and Discussion\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Criteria for grading\r\n1.\tProject I: 35% (outline draft \u201410%; draft 2\u201410%; final draft: 15%)\r\n2.\tProject II: 35% (outline draft \u201410%; draft 2\u201410%; final draft: 15%)\r\n3.\tAssignments and In-class Practices: 30%\r\n", "materials": "Requirements:\r\n1.Your regular attendance is required to pass this course.  3 unexcused absences from class will result failing grade for this course.
