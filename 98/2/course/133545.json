In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the issue of aesthetics (the study of ideas about beauty and about art).   In light of our previous discussions about the nature of good and evil, we will consider how Western culture values art and beauty, in particular the way in which beauty has been both associated with and opposed to the good.  Our topics will include:  the differences between the good and the beautiful;  Western conceptions of beauty; the nature of creativity; the lives of artists. \r\n", "schedule": "\r\n1\tIntro\r\n\tDefinitions   \r\n\r\n2\tAesthetics (intro article)\t\r\n\r\n3\t(con\u2019t)\r\n\r\n4\tPygmalion\r\n\tWilde, \u201cThe Happy Prince\u201d\t\t\t\r\n\r\n5\tRuskin, \u201cThe Quarry\u201d\r\n\r\n6\tPater, \u201cIntroduction to The Renaissance\u201d and \u201cConclusion\r\n\r\n7   \t(con\u2019t)\t\t \r\n\r\n8\tWilde, Dorian Gray (excerpts)\r\n\r\n9\tMIDTERM\r\n\r\n10\tWilde, \u201cCritic as Artist\u201d\r\n\r\n11\tWilde, Quotations\r\n\r\n12\tBell, \u201cWhat is Painting?\u201d \r\n\r\n13 \t(con\u2019t)\t\t\r\n\r\n14\t(con\u2019t)\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n15\tFilm:  Wilde\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n16\tFilm discussion\t\t\t\r\n\r\n17\tFINAL EXAM\t\r\n\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Midterm  33.3%\r\nFinal\t33.3%\r\nQuiz\t33.3%\r\n", "materials": "Course reader", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
