This course attemps to provide a brief introduction to those models and methods most likely to be encountered and used by students in their careers in engineering and sciences.\r\nThe exposition is relatively modest in terms of mathematical development. Substantial use of the calculus is required in this course.\r\nThis course also introduces general sciences through documentaries. Statistics and probability parts in documentaries will be extracted and discussed by students.", "schedule": "Week  1:     Overview and Descriptive Statistics\r\nWeeks 2-3:   Probability\r\nWeeks 4-5:   Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions\r\nWeeks 6-7:   Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions\r\nWeek 8:      Midterm simulation\r\nWeek 9:      Midterm\r\nWeeks 10-11: Joint Probability Distributions and Random Samples\r\nWeeks 12-13: Point Estimation\r\nWeeks 14-15: Statistical Intervals Based on a Single Sample\r\nWeek  16:    Final simulation\r\nWeek  17:    Final\r\nWeek  18:    V-learning\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Activity in class: 30% (+/-5% with 95% of confidence)\r\nMidterm: 30% (+/-5% with 95% of confidence)\r\nFinal: 40% (+/-5% with 95% of confidence)\r\n", "materials": "Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences (7th Ed.)\r\nby Jay L.
