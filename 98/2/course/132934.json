Topics include Linear Algebra (Matrices, Determinants, Linear System of Eqns, Matrix Eigenvalue Problems), Vector Analysis, Fourier Analysis and PDE. The objective of the course is to train students to have the capability in applying mathematics in solving engineering problems. In addition to introduction of the method of solving mathematical equations, their physical meaning and the basic idea of these topics will be carefully introduced. etc.", "schedule": "1\tIntroduction\r\n2\t6.1 Basic Concepts: Matrix Addition, Scalar Multiplication\r\n6.2 Matrix Multiplication\r\n3\t6.3 Linear System of Eqns.
