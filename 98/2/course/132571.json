Weights used to determine the final score will be:\r\n1. Homework problems, 15%\r\n2. In-Class Activities, Quizzes 10%\r\n3. Two exams, 60% (midterm 30%, final 30%)\r\n4. Final Project, 15%\r\nHomework Rules:\t\t\r\n1.\tHomework problems are due at the beginning of class.\r\n2.\tPlease work the homework early to avoid lateness due to computer crashes.\r\n3.\tAnswer keys will be posted on http://elearning.ntut.edu.tw \r\n4.\tYou may discuss with others how to begin working problems, but you must work the problem entirely yourself to hand in for credit. You may not share computer files for homework problems until the case study.\r\n5.\tAnyone who share computer files or copy homework from classmates will subject to a 50% off his/her homework credit.\r\nExams:\r\nAll exams will be held in our normal classroom.\r\nFinal Exam:\r\nAll students must take the final exam to pass the course. Finals will not be given at any other time. There will not be a makeup exam.\r\n", "materials": "References:\r\n1.\tL. E.
