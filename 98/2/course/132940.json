Before any new building strats designing, subsurface investion should be conducted. During the soil exploration, samples will be taked and tested in the lab. The soil testing report can be generated from those testing results. The soil testing program in this class is divided into two parts. The first part(before midterm) will include the soil testings which can conclude the soil classification. The second part(after midterm) will include the soil testings which can provide the soil mechanical properties for design purpose.", "schedule": "1.  introduction of soil testing program\r\n2.  water content testing\r\n3.
