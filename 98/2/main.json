In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people. Besides, since the prophetic visions are omnipresen\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u25b3", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u96fb\u4e8c\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=1139", "code": "1139"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u9673\u6f54\u660e", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=21730", "code": "21730"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["3", "4"], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559303(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=46", "code": "46"}], "people": "52", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "132388", "code": "1400210", "name": {"zh": "\u53f0\u7063\u53f2", "en": "The History of Taiwan"}, "description": {"zh": "\u53f0\u7063\u7684\u6b77\u53f2\u5f9e\u7121\u6587\u5b57\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u8d77\uff0c\u523017\u4e16\u7d00\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u3001\u8377\u862d\u6d77\u4e0a\u7af6\u9010\u958b\u59cb\uff0c\u6f22\u4eba\u96a8\u4e4b\u79fb\u58be\u53f0\u7063\uff0c\u6210\u70ba\u9019\u584a\u571f\u5730\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u4f4f\u6c11\u3002\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u7684\u5167\u5bb9\u5c07\u4f9d\u6642\u9593\u5148\u5f8c\uff0c\u5c07\u8377\u862d\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u6b96\u6c11\u6642\u671f\u3001\u912d\u6c0f\u738b\u570b\u3001\u6e05\u4ee3\u53f0\u7063\u3001\u65e5\u6cbb\u6642\u671f\u8207\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u6642\u671f\u91cd\u8981\u6b77\u53f2\u5927\u4e8b\u3001\u4eba\u7269\u7b49\u4f9d\u64da\u8b1b\u7fa9\u8b1b\u89e3\uff0c\u5167\u5bb9\u6709\u653f\u6cbb\u3001\u5b97\u6559\u3001\u6587\u5316\u3001\u7d93\u6fdf\u3001\u793e\u6703\u7b49\u5404\u5c64\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u4eba\u7269\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b77\u53f2\u767c\u5c55\u3002\n", "en": "The history of Taiwan originated from the aboriginal culture in which no written languages were included.

In Eastern and Western world, there exist a diversity of classics in all fields of activities. Classics are highly recommended just because they point out eternal ideas to follow and they are considered the starting point to think about. The value of Classics increases as they break through the limit of space and time. \r\nThis course teaches the students how to read important Classics so that the learners--as they know better ways to study and do research on Classics-will go into the deeper parts of the Classics more systematically. By studying classics where universal implications are available, we are able to take advantage of the commonly acknowledged principles to build up the fundamentally communicative paths with other people.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill. As a response to this concern, a new discipline, engineering ethics, is emerging for undergraduate engineering courses. This discipline will doubtless take its place alongside such well-established fields as medical ethics, business ethics, and legal ethics. This course aims to help engineering students gain a broad understanding of professionalism and its vital contribution to society.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u5316\u56db\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=941", "code": "941"}, {"name": "\u56db\u5316\u56db\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=942", "code": "942"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8a31\u9707\u6bc5", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=22346", "code": "22346"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["3", "4"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559206(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=40", "code": "40"}], "people": "15", "peopleWithdraw": "0", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "132497", "code": "1004002", "name": {"zh": "\u9ad4\u80b2", "en": "Physical Education"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u6821\u9ad4\u80b2\u8ab2\u7a0b\u76ee\u6a19\u70ba\u935b\u934a\u5065\u5168\u8eab\u5fc3\u3001\u4fc3\u9032\u8eab\u5fc3\u5065\u5168\u767c\u5c55\u3001\u57f9\u990a\u904b\u52d5\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u767c\u63da\u5718\u968a\u7cbe\u795e\u53ca\u990a\u6210\u7d42\u8eab\u904b\u52d5\u7fd2\u6163\u3002\u56db\u6280\u56db\u5e74\u7d1a\u4e0b\u5b78\u671f\u5be6\u65bd\u9078\u4fee\u5c08\u9805\u5206\u7d44\u6559\u5b78\uff0c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4fee\u7562\u6709\u4e00\u5b78\u5206\u4e26\u8a08\u5165\u7562\u696d\u5b78\u5206\u5167\u3002\u7531\u5177\u6709\u5c08\u9577\u4e4b\u6559\u5e2b\u6388\u8ab2\u3002\u958b\u8ab2\u9805\u76ee\uff1a\u7c43\u7403\u3001\u6392\u7403\u3001\u684c\u7403\u3001\u7fbd\u7403\u3001\u4fdd\u9f61\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u7bad\u3001\u9ad8\u723e\u592b\u7403\u3001\u7db2\u7403\u3001\u9ad4\u64cd\u904a\u6232\u3001\u6162\u901f\u58d8\u7403\u3001\u592a\u6975\u62f3\u3001\u570b\u969b\u6a19\u6e96\u821e\u3001\u9ad4\u9069\u80fd\u3001\u570b\u8853\u3002\u5b78\u751f\u5f97\u6309\u81ea\u5df1\u8208\u8da3\u9078\u64c7\u4fee\u7fd2\u3002\n", "en": "In second semester, Senior students also can choose to attend two hours per week of Physical Education class.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

The topics it discusses concern some basic questions for we human beings and the world around us.  These basic questions at least include: the universe, knowledge, equality and justice, morality, religion, language, mind, society, education, love, and life and death.  Thinking things philosophically is to reflect upon these basic questions.  The reflection of this sort leads us to understand not only the basic principles behind these questions,   also the reasons and procedures of the possible solutions to these questions.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

In the first semester, the course covers important articles in literature, in the hope for the student learners to cultivate better ability to taste literary works when they have more vivid sense on the language. With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts. It is our expectation that throughout the reading and analysis of various great schools of philosophy, the student learners are given the opportunity to explore the huge minds of philosophers, who will thus be imitated and followed.

When art is used to express feelings, advocate religions, propagandizing politics, or transmitting thoughts, it never needs any reason. Don't say that you don't know what art is! In the 21st century, art is no longer the privilege of wealthy ladies. But you all, the future designers and architects, should work harder to make yourself inseparable with art. When you are sharing your own experience about esthetics, exploring different art sects, analyzing art styles, engaging in cultural creative design, or criticizing the contemporary art sects, you have the right to speak up. \r\nThe ten speeches in this series will be delivered by many experts from different fields.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

When art is used to express feelings, advocate religions, propagandizing politics, or transmitting thoughts, it never needs any reason. Don't say that you don't know what art is! In the 21st century, art is no longer the privilege of wealthy ladies. But you all, the future designers and architects, should work harder to make yourself inseparable with art. When you are sharing your own experience about esthetics, exploring different art sects, analyzing art styles, engaging in cultural creative design, or criticizing the contemporary art sects, you have the right to speak up. \r\nThe ten speeches in this series will be delivered by many experts from different fields.

With fuller knowledge on what literature is about, they are expected to try creative writings. For the second semester, the course is mainly focused on the writings on thoughts.

Engineering ethics is attracting increasing interest among colleges of engineering and universities throughout the well-developed high-tech countries. The increasing concern for the ethic and value dimensions of engineering is, at least in part, a result of the attention that the media has given to cases such as the Challenger disaster of the NASA, the public safety of poor infrastructure, the collapse of buildings in the 921 earthquake, and the environmental pollution due to oil spill. As a response to this concern, a new discipline, engineering ethics, is emerging for undergraduate engineering courses. This discipline will doubtless take its place alongside such well-established fields as medical ethics, business ethics, and legal ethics. This course aims to help engineering students gain a broad understanding of professionalism and its vital contribution to society.\r\nThe class in\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "2.0", "hours": "2", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u6750\u4e8c\u7532", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=1144", "code": "1144"}, {"name": "\u56db\u6750\u4e8c\u4e59", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=1145", "code": "1145"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u8a31\u9707\u6bc5", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=22346", "code": "22346"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": [], "tue": [], "wed": [], "thu": ["1", "2"], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u4e09\u6559506(e)", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=63", "code": "63"}], "people": "38", "peopleWithdraw": "3", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "136074", "code": "3534036", "name": {"zh": "\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u5316\u5b78\u7279\u8ad6", "en": "Special Topics of Polymer Chemistry"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u5167\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u93c8\u4e4b\u7d71\u8a08\u529b\u5b78\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u4e4b\u754c\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u53caFlory-Huggin\u7406\u8ad6\u3002\r\n  \u5c0d\u65bc\u7d21\u7e54\u6280\u8853\u5b78\u7a0b\u7684\u898f\u5283\uff0c\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u6703\u6ce8\u91cd\u7d21\u7e54\u7e96\u7dad\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6280\u8853\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7528\u5948\u7c73\u6280\u8853\u52a0\u5728Nylon\u7e96\u7dad\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4ee5clay\u52a0\u5f37Nylon\u7684\u5f37\u5ea6\u53ca\u78e8\u8017\u6027\u8cea\uff0c\u7528\u7406\u8ad6\u7684\u63a2\u8a0e\u4f8b\u5982\u7528Halpin-Tsai equation\u53bb\u9810\u6e2c\u7d21\u7e54\u7e96\u7dad\u7684\u694a\u6c0f\u4fc2\u6578\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u4e5f\u6703\u52a0\u5f37\u9ad8\u5206\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b78\u5728\u7d21\u7e54\u7e96\u7dad\u6210\u578b\u904e\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6240\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\n", "en": "The course includes; statistics of polymer chain, interfacial polymer force, Florry-Huggun theory.\r\nA major objective of this course is to provide a background in polymerizations, polymer structures and polymer properties.

Catherine Belsey answers that it is because of his singularity.

Besides, Shakespeare has been cherished for his powerful poetry and stagecraft, his nonpareil grasp of human nature, and his remarkable philosophical insights into life. As people often observe, Shakespeare may trigger our imagination with his language and promote effective communication in every aspect of our life, including that of our careers. For these important reasons, this course aims to guide students to appreciate Shakespeare by focusing on a number of his plays.\n"}, "stage": "1", "credit": "3.0", "hours": "3", "courseType": "\u2605", "class": [{"name": "\u56db\u82f1\u56db", "link": "Subj.jsp?format=-4&year=98&sem=2&code=955", "code": "955"}], "teacher": [{"name": "\u4f59\u76db\u5ef6", "link": "Teach.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=10465", "code": "10465"}], "time": {"sun": [], "mon": ["5", "6"], "tue": [], "wed": ["5"], "thu": [], "fri": [], "sat": []}, "classroom": [{"name": "\u5171\u540c301_2", "link": "Croom.jsp?format=-3&year=98&sem=2&code=478", "code": "478"}], "people": "20", "peopleWithdraw": "2", "ta": [], "language": "\u3000", "notes": "\u3000"}, {"id": "136366", "code": "5403212", "name": {"zh": "\u9ad8\u7d1a\u5beb\u4f5c(\u4e8c)", "en": "Advanced English Writing (II)"}, "description": {"zh": "\u672c\u8ab2\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u57f9\u990a\u9032\u968e\u5beb\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a1\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u5c0e\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8af8\u5982\u66f8\u51fd\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\uff0f\u66f8\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u8a55\u8ad6\uff0c\u5275\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b78\u8853\u5c08\u6280\u5831\u544a\u7b49\u5c08\u9805\u9032\u884c\u6f14\u7df4\u3002\n", "en": "This course, using a functionally-oriented approach, aims at increasing university-level EFL writing students' English writing skills and developing them into more fluent, confident writers.

Songs are a rhythmic form of language. They record and reflect human histories before written symbols are invented. The history of songs can therefore best show specific historical changes. In early years of Taiwan aboriginal society, songs were used to entertain both gods and people and had social functions. As Han people brought in agriculture from mainland China, songs, poetry, and theater had closely related to sacrificial rites.

You have to care about all walks of life, and actively observe and record their figures. Try to master both the charm and the form of the model.  Next focusing on static mono-figure sketching, you have to demonstrate your techniques in presenting either the static or the dynamic, the state of tension or looseness. You also have to be precise in proportion when you do your sketch. Stress definitely on the practice of speediness, simplicity, accuracy, and preciseness. Also work on static twin-figure and multi-figure sketching.

Through the study on the shape, the incised decoration and the function of the jade, we can understand the primitive religion and the ritual life in the Three Dynasties, as well as the witchcrafts practiced since Eastern Chou. As an art form, the jade is a concrete object, but in effect it embodies the spiritual life of people, enriching and reflecting the metaphysical aspects of culture, which serves as a starting point for exploring aesthetic concepts. This course aims to integrate authropological and cultural aesthetic perspectives. With the assistance of the recently unearthed jade, the emphasis is put on ancient people's idea of jade and their usage of it.
