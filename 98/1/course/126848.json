In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the theme of good and evil, in particular the importance of these two concepts to an understanding of the role of the hero in American culture.  Examining essays and films about the nature of good and evil, heroes and villains, we will consider why the vocabulary of the hero and the heroic is so widespread in American politics and popular culture, and what the rhetoric of good and evil tells us about Western society and its people.", "schedule": "Week 1\t9/14\tcourse intro  (allusions[\u201cAxis of Wrong\u201d]; definitions)\r\n\r\nWeek 2\t9/21\tBush 9/11 speeches\r\n\r\nWeek 3\t9/28\t\t (continued)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nWeek 4\t10/5\tReflective essays:  \u201cAxis of Wrong\u201d;  \u201cTriumph of Goneril and Regan\u201d \r\n\r\nWeek 5   \t10/12\t \t(continued) \r\n\r\nWeek 6   \t10/19   Aristotle, The Good\r\n\r\nWeek 7 \t10/26\tEvil in Popular Culture I:  \u201cConcept of Evil in Harry Potter\u201d (essay)\r\n\r\nWeek 8  \t11/2\t\t(continued)\r\n\r\nWeek 9\t11/9\tMIDTERM\r\n\r\n\r\nWeek 10 \t11/16\t Film:  LOTR: The Two Towers\r\n\r\nWeek 11\t11/23\tEvil in Popular Culture II:  \u201cEvil in LOTR\u201d (essay)\r\n     \r\nWeek 12\t11/30\t\t(continued)\t\t\r\n\r\nWeek 13   \t12/7\t  no class\r\n\r\nWeek 14 \t12/14   Auden, \u201cThe Quest\u201d   \r\n\r\nWeek 15   \t12/21\t\t(continued)\r\n\r\nWeek 16  \t12/28\tCampbell, \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d\r\n\r\nWeek 17  \t1/4\t\t(continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n", "scorePolicy": "\r\nGrades:\r\n\tMidterm  33.3%\r\n\tFinal\t   33.3%\r\n\tQuizzes  33.3%\r\n\r\n\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n \r\n", "materials": "Course reader", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
