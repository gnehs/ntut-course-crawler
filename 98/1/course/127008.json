The instructor will check students\u2019 notes and homework at irregular intervals. If a student is found to not have done the preview or homework, 20 points will be deducted from his or her quiz that week.\r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8003\u548c\u88dc\u8003) Quizzes are always administered at the beginning of the class. Late students can ask for make-up quizzes administered by the teaching assistant, but 20 points will be automatically deducted. An absent student, with or without a justifiable reason, cannot ask for a make-up quiz. Yet, for all students, one lowest quiz grade needs not to be factored into the average calculation.\r\n\r\n(\u4f5c\u6587\u548c\u53e3\u982d\u5831\u544a/\u8868\u6f14) Projects are based on the Writing and Discussion sections in the textbook. However, some sections are not suitable. Students will be notified what sections are not suitable. One project is in written form and done individually. The other is performed orally and physically and done collectively in groups. Written project can be submitted any time during the semester but no later than December 25, 2009. Otherwise, it will be given a zero automatically. With regard to the group project, students are free to decide the form and content. However, the chosen form and content should be approved by the instructor in advance. Some suggested forms for the performed projects are debate, skit, teaching demonstration, etc. \r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8001\u5e2b) Teaching assistant will be awarded 3 bonus points to his or her final grade. \r\n\r\n(\u4f5c\u5f0a\u548c\u6284\u8972) Any student caught cheating or plagiarizing in quizzes, exams, or projects will be given a zero for his or her final grade without any room of negotiation. \r\n\r\n", "materials": "Essential Reading 4 (by Amanda French)", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
