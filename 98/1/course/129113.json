In the course of practicing such skills, we will follow from our reading class and take as our general topic the concept of good and evil, with a special focus on conversation as a free, improvised, exchange of ideas (as opposed to the prepared speeches required for public speaking and dramatic performances).  Our topics will include:  stories from film and books; non-fiction accounts of famous heroes and villains; narratives of our own personal journeys and conceptions of the good.  \r\n\r\n", "schedule": "\r\nWeek 1\t9/14\tIntro:  \u201cgood\u201d phrases\r\nWeek 2\t9/21\tIdeas/expression relating to the Good (Personal Narrative)\r\nWeek 3\t9/28\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 4\t10/5\tDefining the bad: rules that should or should not be broken\r\nWeek 5\t10/12\t\tpart 2\r\nWeek 6\t10/19\tPrinciples to Live by\t\t\r\nWeek 7\t10/26\t\tpart 2\t\t\t\t\r\nWeek 8\t11/2\t20 Questions\t\r\nWeek 9\t11/9\tMIDTERM\r\nWeek 10\t11/16\tGroup story\t\r\nWeek 11\t11/23\tQuotations: evil/devil\r\nWeek 12\t11/30\t\tpart 2\t\t\r\nWeek 13\t12/7\tNews report:  evil\r\nWeek 14\t12/14  \t\t continued\r\nWeek 15\t12/21\t\tcontinued\t\r\nWeek 16\t12/28\tFilm:   Fisher King\r\nWeek 17\t1/4\tfilm discussion\r\n\r\n", "scorePolicy": "\r\nGrades:\r\n\tMidterm  \t33.3%\r\n\tFinal  \t\t33.3%\r\n\tParticipation  \t33.3%\r\n\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 5 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade\r\n \r\n", "materials": "\r\nGrading for midterm and final projects on will be based on criteria such as clarity, fluency, originality, and effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
