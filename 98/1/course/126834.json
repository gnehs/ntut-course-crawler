Students learn to select topics, collect essential information, analyze the audience, organize materials, improve delivery skills, distinguish different types of speeches, and further to evaluate their own and others\u2019 speeches. Each student is expected to deliver at least 4 individual speeches, and 2-3 debates. Speech topics will be assigned to students. Any modifications of the speech topics will have to be approved by the instructor. All student speech sessions must be videotaped.(*1)\r\nCourse Requirements: \tStudents\u2019 responsibilities in this class include:\r\n(1)\tAttending class regularly and to arrive on time: a sign-in sheet to record attendance / a grade reduction of 10% of the semester grade for each session absence\r\n(2)\tDelivering speeches as scheduled:\r\ni.\tStudents are required to present their speeches on the day scheduled;\r\nii.\tMake-up speech will be allowed only when the failure to perform is due to an officially excused absence or incidents under extreme circumstances\r\niii.\tThe ideal time duration for each speech is 4 to 6 minutes. The minimum length of speech time is 3 minutes, and the maximum 6 minutes. Violation of the time limit (less than 3 and more than 6) constitutes a failure w/o points awarded. The time length for debates will vary due to the different formats employed.\r\n(3)\tSubmitting to the instructor a speaker\u2019s dossier with inclusion of the outlined speech as well as its full-length version, the self-evaluating commentary of previous presentation(s) and also blank A-4 size lined sheets for notes and feedbacks (see Appendix 1) when presenting the speech. Students who fail to submit the dossier as scheduled and also to comply with the outline format requirements (sampled and specified below) forfeit the right to deliver the speech and hence receive zero points.\r\n(4)\tStudent speakers are also required to display your outline slide(s) during the speech.\r\n(5)\tEvaluating one\u2019s own speech: all speeches have to be videotaped by the student speaker. Student speakers are required to watch their own videotaped performance, observe their own speeches, and compile all speech and debate evaluation for submission. Students are strongly advised to use their own videotaping devices. A complete electronic portfolio (on compact disc) needs to be established and submitted at the semester end.\r\n(6)\tStudent Evaluation Panel: An evaluation panel comprising three students will be organized to be responsible for feedbacks and comments. Three panels will be invited to evaluate one topic of speech. Feedbacks and comments will be given orally at the exhaustion of the speaker list. Written evaluation report will be required for submission a week after.\r\n", "schedule": "2009 English Public Speaking and Debates\r\nWeekly Syllabus\r\nWeek/ Date \tCourse Content\tFormat\r\nWk1\tOrientation \tInstructor Lecture & Discussion\r\nWk2\tGuidelines to Public Speaking\tInstructor Lecture\r\nWk3\tIntroductory Speech Group 1 & 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk4\tGuidelines to Informative / Persuasive / Analytical Speech \tInstructor Lecture\r\nWk5\tInformative Speech Group 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk6\tInformative Speech Group 1\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk7\tPersuasive Speech Group 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk8\tPersuasive Speech Group 1\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk9\tAnalytical Speech Group 1\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk10\tAnalytical Speech Group 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk11\tGuidelines to Debate: its logic and format\tInstructor Lecture\r\nWk12\tDebate Preparation \tInstructor Lecture& Discussion\r\nWk13\tStandardized Format Debate\r\nGroup 1 & 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk14\tDebate Preparation \tInstructor Lecture& Discussion\r\nWk15\tCross-Exam Debate Group 2\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk16\tCross-Exam Debate Group 1\tStudent Presentation\r\nWk17\tNo Class (January 1st)\r\nWk18\tFinal Debate Match\tStudent Presentation\r\n", "scorePolicy": "Grading Policy: \t(1) Academic honesty is prioritized in this class.

Each absence will generate 10% point deduction of the semester grades on the 100% scale.\r\n*3) All extemporaneous speeches allow speakers to deliver the speech with its outline and necessary visual aids, such as flash cards, posters and PPT slides. Student speakers who use a script at speech delivery will result in the total loss of the component grade.\r\n*4) The implementation of the final debate match is likely to be subject to certain contingent occurrences as the class proceeds. Exact date, format and related matters will have to be discussed and determined later in the semester.\r\n* 5) Students are required to submit the speech assessment portfolio at the end of the semester. Failure to submit the portfolio will override the grades received in other grading components and thus results in a failing grade.\r\n", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
