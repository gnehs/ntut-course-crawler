The instructor will check students\u2019 notes and homework at irregular intervals. If a student is found to not have done the preview or homework, 20 points will be deducted from his or her quiz that week.\r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8003\u548c\u88dc\u8003) Quizzes are always administered at the beginning of the class. Late students can ask for make-up quizzes administered by the teaching assistant, but 20 points will be automatically deducted. An absent student, with or without a justifiable reason, cannot ask for a make-up quiz. Yet, for all students, one lowest quiz grade needs not to be factored into the average calculation.\r\n\r\n(\u5c0f\u8001\u5e2b) Teaching assistant will be awarded 3 bonus points to his or her final grade.\r\n\r\n(\u4f5c\u5f0a\u53ca\u6284\u8972) Any student caught cheating or plagiarizing in quizzes, exams, or skits will be given a zero for his or her final grade without any room of negotiation.\r\n", "materials": "Interactions 1\u2014Reading (by E.
