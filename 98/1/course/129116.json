Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.\r\nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult\u2019s My Sister\u2019s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students\u2019 vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.\r\n", "schedule": "9/17\tWriter\u2019s Block; Geeting the Main Ideas\r\n        \u201cMisconceptions about Writing\u201d\r\n9/24\tFinding the Topic; Topic Sentence\t\u201c\r\n         Gary Larson\u2019s Cartoon\u201d\r\n         My Sister\u2019s Keeper(pp. 1-21)\r\n10/1\tActive Reading; Observing\r\n         \u201dReading a Painting\u201d\r\n         M: 22-43\r\n10/8\tFree Association\r\n\u201cProspect Park\u201d\r\nM: 44-68\r\n10/15\tFinding the Central Idea\r\n\u201cThe Match\u201d\r\nM: 69-101\r\n10/22\tTalking about Memories\r\n\u201cA Sketch of the Past\u201d\r\nM: 102-117\r\n10/29\tDialogue with a Text\r\n\u201cDaddy Tucked\u2026\u201d\r\nM: 118-139\r\n11/5\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n11/12\tM: 140-196\tProject I completed\r\n11/19\tHow to Write a Summary\r\n\u201cOur Barbies, Ourselves\u201d\r\nM: 197--264\r\n11/26\tHow to Write a Paraphrase\r\n\u201cAn Anthropologist on Mars\u201d\r\nM: 265-326\r\n12/3    \u201cCat in the Rain\u201d\r\nM: 327-389\r\n12/10\tAnalysis paper vs.Reflection paper\r\n\u201cNecklace\u201d\r\nM:390-423\r\n12/17\tWriting an Analysis\r\n\u201cStory of an Hour\u201d\r\nM:425-500\r\n12/24\tCharacter Analysis\r\nDraft of Project II\r\n12/31\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\r\n1/7\tBook Review on My Sister\u2019s Keeper\r\n1/14\tReview and Discussion\r\nProject II completed", "scorePolicy": "Criteria for Grading\r\n1.Project I--35% : 1st draft: 10%;\r\n2nd draft: 10%;\r\nfinal draft: 15%\r\n2.Project II\u201440%: reading portfolio: 10%;\r\n1st draft: 10%;\r\nrevised draft: 20%\r\n3.Attendance, In class practice, Peer-reviewing and comments,\r\nAssignments: 25%\r\n", "materials": "Textbooks:\r\n1.
