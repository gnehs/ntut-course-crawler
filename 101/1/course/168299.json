In the course of practicing such skills, we will take as our general topic the theme of good and evil, in particular the importance of these two concepts to an understanding of the role of the hero in American culture.  Examining essays and films about the nature of good and evil, heroes and villains, we will consider why the vocabulary of the hero and the heroic is so widespread in American politics and popular culture, and what the rhetoric of good and evil tells us about Western society and its people.", "schedule": "Week 1\t\tcourse intro  \r\n\r\nWeek 2-3\tBush 9/11 speeches\r\n\r\nWeek 4-5\tReflective essays:  \u201cAxis of Wrong\u201d\u2019;  \u201cTriumph of Goneril and Regan\u201d \r\n\r\nWeek 6 -8\tPlato, Aristotle, and the Good\r\n\r\nWeek 9\t\tMIDTERM\r\n\r\nWeek 10-12 \t Evil in Popular Culture I: HP on Evil \r\n\r\nWeek 13-15 \t Evil in Popular Culture II: LOTR on Evil \r\n\r\nWeek 16-17  \tCampbell, \u201cThe Hero\u2019s Journey\u201d\r\n\r\nWeek 18           FINAL", "scorePolicy": "Midterm  33.3%\r\nFinal\t   33.3%\r\nQuizzes  33.3%\r\nAttendance:   a combination of 4 absences or late days =  -10 points from course grade", "materials": "Course reader", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
