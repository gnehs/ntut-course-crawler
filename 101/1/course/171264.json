Many such conventions are actually flexible; one does well to flow them unless there is some reason not to.  Of all the conventions in academic written discourse, however, one remains recalcitrant.  IT will be followed or your paper just sort of naturally sinks to the bottom of the swimming pool to drown.  It has no mooring, is fundamentally disconnected from the main.  The \u201cmain\u201d being the world of ideas in which we are training you to communicate.  To communicate intelligibly on a college level you must demonstrate a command of the ideas with which shape your thesis.  Since only a few of the ideas in your essay will be, strictly speaking, your own invention, you must (indeed it is your sacred duty to) honestly inform your reader which ideas come from what source.  If you do not inform the reader of the origin of an idea that comes from an outside source, it does not matter the quality of your work in other ways, it is a an embarrassing failure.  It is a slap in the face of true scholarship.  So the typical college-level research paper, thesis or dissertation will contain a multitude of quotations, all with transition connecting together your own ideas and observations, presumably proving a case if that is what you are arguing or deepening meaning if you\u2019re exploring an aesthetic, literary or philosophical idea.  But all of these quotatations, paraphrases and summaries mustneeds have a system of categorization to make it easier for the reader to understand and evaluate the source-material being used.  For this reason, a few, common systems for documenting sources emerged.  In our course we will study one of the two most popular forms of in-text citation, foot-note notation and bibliography reference.  It is called the MLA format, after the Modern Language Association.  The MLA is the form of reference most commonly used for writing in the humanities, while the APA (which you have already learned or will learn the second half of the semester) is most suited for the Social Science.  But you must be consistent in your choice.  Only MLA shall be used or only APA should be used.  In this course we will use only MLA.", "schedule": "COURSE SCHEDULE I\r\n\r\n \r\nSeptember 17\tIntroduction  ASSIGNMENT:  LOCATE AT LEAST ONE SOURCE (EITHER A BOOK, A COMPLETE PDF FILE FROM COMPUTER.
