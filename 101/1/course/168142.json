Students will learn about basic structural systems, materials, patterns, and \u201crules of thumb\u201d proportioning of members. Fundamental concepts of structural design will be introduced, including loads and force flow, statics and engineering mechanics, truss analysis, and buckling behavior.", "schedule": "Class Schedule:\r\n1.
