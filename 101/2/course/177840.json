This semester, we will start by dedicating the first four lessons to explaining the (re)discovery of the aesthetic value of the nature, characteristics of its appreciation, as well as challenges it raises to traditional aesthetics dominated by appreciation of art particularly since the time of Hegel. The course will then progress in applying successively the conclusions gained in this first stage, to related fields such as aesthetic education, environmental art, landscape, architecture and human environments (urbanism and everyday aesthetics), and present finally the idea of functional beauty recently rediscovered and developed in environmental aesthetics. Students will be asked to apply the knowledge imparted in the classroom to appreciation and/or improvement of one district of Taipei City each team chooses to be its object of study. The oral presentation will take place in the two weeks right before the final exam.", "schedule": "1. Environmental aesthetics and the aesthetics of nature\r\n2. Formalism and cognitivism\r\n3.
