By a series of initial short projects, students will be required to develop attitudes - spatial, contextual, structural, and phenomenological - toward the assigned design problems. By identifying and cataloging these attitudes and intentions, students will develop a rigorous set of guidelines against which their proposals may be critiqued. Students will learn various methods of representation for their ideas, and will work in model form and both freehand and hard-line drawings. Students will be encouraged to remain away from digital means of representation until late in the semester. This studio will be an opportunity for students to challenge and develop strong manual skill sets and learn to rely on ready methods of visual and physical exploration. This studio will have a rigorous emphasis on the development of a personal working method. The curriculum and evaluation methods will recognize design as a process, not a product, and constant evaluation and evolution of that process will be of paramount importance.", "schedule": "Class Schedule:\r\nWeek 1-8: \tProject 1 \u2013 Analysis and Small Spatial Construction\r\nWeek 9: \t\tMidterm Jury\r\nWeek 10-17: \tProject 2 \u2013 Compound\r\nWeek 18: \tFinal Review", "scorePolicy": "Grading:\r\nA: Outstanding Work (90-100)\r\nB: High Quality Work (80-89)\r\nC: Satisfactory Work (70-79)\r\nD: Less Than Satisfactory Work (60-69)\r\nF: Unsatisfactory Work (0-59)", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
