Emphasis is placed on developing an understanding of basic systematic and elemental behavior; principles of structural behavior and analysis of individual structural elements and strategies for load carrying. The subject introduces fundamental energy topics including thermodynamics, psychrometrics, and comfort, as they relate to building design and construction.", "schedule": "Class Schedule:\r\n1.\tStructures Web\r\n2.\tSynergy of Form and Structure\r\n3.\tStructure Systems & Selection\r\n4.\tTensile Structure\r\n5.\tSuspension Bridges\r\n6.\tArch and Vault\r\n7.\tMembranes\r\n8.\tBeam & Frame\r\n9.\tMidterm Exam\r\n10.\tTruss\r\n11.\tStayed Structure\r\n12.\tVierendeel & Shell\r\n13.\tFolded Plate & Cylindrical Shell\r\n14.\tWood Structure & Hardware\r\n15.\tFoundation\r\n16.\tHorizontal/Vertical Structures\r\n17.\tSuspended High-Rise\r\n18.\tFinal Exam", "scorePolicy": "Attendance\t\t20%\r\nHomework\t\t30%\r\nSemester Project\t20%\r\nFinal Exam\t\t30%", "materials": "Allen, E. and Zalewski, W.
