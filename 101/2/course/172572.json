Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schr\u00f6dinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.", "schedule": "week 1   Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Structure(Review)\r\nweek 2   Quantum Mechanics and Molecular Structure(I)\r\nweek 3   Quantum Mechanics and Molecular Structure(II)\r\nweek 4   Bonding in Organic Molecules(I)\r\nweek 5   Bonding in Organic Molecules(II)\r\nweek 6   Bonding in Transition Metal Compounds(I)\r\nweek 7   Bonding in Transition Metal Compounds(II)\r\nweek 8   The Gaseous State(I)\r\nweek 9   The Gaseous State(II)\r\nweek 10  Solid, Liquids, Phase Transitions, and Chemical Equilibrium\r\nweek 11  Thermodynamic Processes and Thermochemistry(I)\r\nweek 12  Thermodynamic Processes and Thermochemistry(II)\r\nweek 13  Spontaneous Processes and Thermodynamic Equilibrium(I)\r\nweek 14  Spontaneous Processes and Thermodynamic Equilibrium(II)\r\nweek 15  Electrochemistry(I)\r\nweek 16  Electrochemistry(II)\r\nweek 17  Chemical Kinetics(I)\r\nweek 18  Chemical Kinetics(II)", "scorePolicy": "\u671f\u4e2d\u8003\uff1a 45%\r\n\u671f\u672b\u8003\uff1a 45%\r\n\u5e73\u6642\u8003\uff1a 10%", "materials": "Textbook : David W.
