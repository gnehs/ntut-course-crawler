Every performance is grounded in writing.  Therefore you must keep a journal of your ideas as they develop\u2014from the inside to the outside.  That is, from personal experience to writing to planning to rehearsing/critiquing to actually performing is a process as significant as any single outcome.  Your journal serves as documentation of your experiences in class, but is also a tool for experimentation and exploration.\r\n2)\tSmall Group: Big Show.  A significant portion of the class will be given over to workshopping your ideas.  The class will provide you a larger forum for this purpose.  Working in pairs or small group, you will assist one another in the preparation of a collaborative performance work.\r\n3)\tPresentations.  In league with the entire class, students will devise guerilla-poetry performances or work to produce an example of \u201cpoet\u2019s theatre.\u201d.  Preparation of this presentation will lead to development and refinement of your own final presentation project.\r\n4)    Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by two grade points.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.\r\n5)    Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.", "scorePolicy": "GRADING\r\n25%\tSmall Group Presentation \r\n25%\tFinal Presentation\t\t\t\t\r\n25%\tParticipation in Class/Radio Play Performance\r\n25% \tWriting Practice", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
