In this course, we will focus on (i) statistical thermodynamics and (ii) chemical kinetics. The basic idea is how to study and to interpret chemical reaction from microscopic point of quantum chemistry to macroscopic point of thermodynamics. Here, statistical thermodynamics provides the link between the microscopic properties of matter and its bulk properties. Then, the rates of chemical reactions and reaction mechanisms will be discussed. Finally, the transition state theory inspires a thermodynamic approach to reaction rates will be applied to discuss the chemical reaction.\r\nOutline :\r\nThe course will include the following main topics :\r\n1.\tStatistical thermodynamics 1: the concepts\r\n2.\tStatistical thermodynamics 2: applications\r\n3.\tMolecules in motion- Kinetic Theory of Gases\r\n4.\tThe rates of chemical reactions\r\n5.\tReaction dynamics", "schedule": "Week 1 :  Probability\r\nWeek 2:\tThe Boltzmann Distribution\r\nWeek 3:\tEnsemble and Molecular Partition Functions (I)\r\nWeek 4: \tEnsemble and Molecular Partition Functions (II)\r\nWeek 5:\tStatistical Thermodynamics (I)\r\nWeek 6:\tStatistical Thermodynamics (II)\r\nWeek 7:\tKinetic Theory of Gases(I)\r\nWeek 8:\tKinetic Theory of Gases(II)\r\nWeek 9:\tMidterm\r\nWeek 10:\tElementary Chemical Kinetics (I)\r\nWeek 11:\tElementary Chemical Kinetics (II)\r\nWeek 12:\tTransition State Theory (I)\r\nWeek 13:\tTransition State Theory (II)\r\nWeek 14:\tThe dynamics of molecular collisions (I)\r\nWeek 15:\tThe dynamics of molecular collisions (II)\r\nWeek 16:\tThe dynamic of electron transfer (I)\r\nWeek 17:\tThe dynamic of electron transfer (II)\r\nWeek 18:\tFinal exam.", "scorePolicy": "\u671f\u4e2d\u8003 50%\r\n\u671f\u672b\u8003 50%", "materials": "Textbook :\r\n1.\tP.
