We will employ a very general structure: Topic-Narrow Topic-(Background reading)-Central Question-Answer (Thesis)-Argument.  There will be writing on cultural artifacts, argument, debate, others.  We will begin by sorting students into groups so that each student can help the others and then gradually shrink the number in each group until as the final exam each student will write their own essay of about 5 pages.", "scorePolicy": "Grading: Group essays = 60%\r\nFinal Solo Essay = 40%", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
