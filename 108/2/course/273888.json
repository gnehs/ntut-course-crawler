Are you curious about society and the way it influences the world around us? Would you like to explore the facade of sociopolitical events? Do you love language and are you fascinated by the power and magic of stories? If not, you will nevertheless learn in this course that literature provides a valuable and inspiring perspective on society. On the other hand, if you have already had a strong passion for literature and if you are already fascinated by literary language, you will learn in this course how to make sense of your world by enriching your vicarious experiences of it through literature. Specifically, by exploring the interaction between literature and society, by studying not only how society gives rise to, contextualizes, and molds literature, but also how literature mirrors, influences, shapes, and changes society, you will realize the power of literature and language and, more importantly, become at home in the world.
