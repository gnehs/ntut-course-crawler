This course introduces the fundamental structures and some advanced ones, including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, maps and dictionaries, hash tables, trees and graphs, as well as priority queues. In addition, the analysis tools and design issues for data structures will be discussed.", "schedule": "1. Introduction and Recursion (3hrs)\r\n2. Analysis Tools (5hrs)\r\n3.
