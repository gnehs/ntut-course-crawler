This course is a calculus-based introduction to statistics, and so designed to help students learn the introductory descriptive and inferential statistical procedures that are used in diverse areas. Mainly, this course deals with the basic concepts of statistical inference and linear models. After a review of descriptive statistics and some necessary probability distributions, interval and point estimation, hypothesis tests, linear regression analysis, and ANOVA are illustrated and accompanied by practical/theoretical exercises. The objective of this course is to introduce students to core ideas of probability and statistics, and also to provide an understanding on statistical concepts to include measurements of location and dispersion, probability, probability distributions, sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, simple and multiple linear regression, factorial designs, and RSM. Consequently, these skills will provide the student with a basis to conduct their own such analyzes and to evaluate critically others\u2019 uses of statistics.", "schedule": "Week 1\tIntroduction to probability distribution, sampling distribution, and estimation\r\nWeek 2\tDecision making for a single sample \u2013 Estimation, hypothesis testing, inference on the mean of a population\r\nWeek 3\tDecision making for a single sample \u2013 Inference on the variance of a normal population, inference on a population proportion, goodness of fit test\r\nWeek 4\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Inference on the means of two populations, paired t-test\r\nWeek 5\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Inference on the ratio of variances of two normal populations, inference on two population proportions\r\nWeek 6\tSimple linear regression \u2013 Part I\r\nWeek 7\tSimple linear regression \u2013 Part II\r\nWeek 8\tOther aspects of simple linear regression\r\nWeek 9\tMidterm exam (In-Class, 1 Cheat Sheet, Calculator)\r\nWeek 10\tMultiple linear regression \u2013 Part I\r\nWeek 11\tMultiple linear regression \u2013 Part II\r\nWeek 12\tOther aspects of multiple linear regression\r\nWeek 13\tFactorial design, replication, center points \u2013 Part I\r\nWeek 14\tFactorial design, replication, center points \u2013 Part II \r\nWeek 15\tBlocking, confounding, fractional factorial designs X-bar and R control chart\r\nWeek 16\tFactorial experiments with more than two levels\r\nWeek 17\tIntroduction to control charts\r\nWeek 18\tFinal exam (In-Class, 1 Cheat sheet, Calculator)", "scorePolicy": "1.
