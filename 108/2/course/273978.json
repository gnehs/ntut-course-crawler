Economics is inherently an evolutionary science, changing to reflect shifting trends in society and the economy. Hopefully at the end of this course, successful students will be able to (1) use economic science methods to explain or predict individual and collective human behavior and decision-making. (2) articulate interdependence of people and places around the globe. (3) understand and apply economic science principles to solve personal, social, and organizational issues.", "schedule": "Week 1-2\uff1aIntroduction & course overview \u5c0e\u8ad6\r\nWeek 3-5\uff1aPrinciples of economics \u7d93\u6fdf\u5b78\u539f\u7406\r\nWeek 6-7\uff1aDemand-supply & market equilibrium \u4f9b\u9700\u53ca\u5e02\u5834\u5747\u8861\r\nWeek 8-9\uff1aElasticity and its applications \u5f48\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u904b\u7528 \r\nWeek 10\uff1aMidterm exam  \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\r\nWeek 11-13\uff1aNational income \u570b\u6c11\u6240\u5f97\r\nWeek 14-15\uff1aPrice index and inflation \u7269\u50f9\u6307\u6578\u53ca\u901a\u81a8\r\nWeek 16-17\uff1aUnemployment \u5931\u696d\r\nWeek 18\uff1aFinal exam  \u671f\u672b\u8003\r\n\uff0aThe instructor will adjust the progress and content based on students\u2019 learning situation. \u6559\u5e2b\u5c07\u8996\u540c\u5b78\u5b78\u7fd2\u60c5\u6cc1\u8abf\u6574\u9032\u5ea6\u8207\u5167\u5bb9", "scorePolicy": "Attendance and Class Participation\uff1a40% \u5e73\u6642\u6210\u7e3e(\u51fa\u52e4\u53ca\u53c3\u8207\u8a0e\u8ad6)\r\nMidterm Exam\uff1a30% \u671f\u4e2d\u8003\r\nFinal Exam\uff1a30% \u671f\u672b\u8003\r\n\uff0aTo attend lectures is important.
