An understanding of this process and its different mechanisms requires you to connect principles of thermodynamics and fluid flow with those of heat transfer. A study of this lecture will teach you how to model the concepts of different modes or mechanisms of heat transfer for practical engineering applications.", "schedule": "week 1: introduction\r\nweek 2: The Heat Diffusion Equation\r\nweek 3: One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\r\nweek 4: One-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\r\nweek 5: Thermal Resistance\r\nweek 6: Heat Transfer from Extended Surfaces\r\nweek 7: Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\r\nweek 8: Two-Dimensional Steady-State Conduction\r\nweek 9: Midterm Exam\r\nweek 10: Transient Conduction\r\nweek 11: The Convection Boundary Layers\r\nweek 12: External and Internal Flow\r\nweek 13: Free Convection\r\nweek 14: Boiling and Condensation\r\nweek 15: Heat Exchanger\r\nweek 16: Heat Exchanger\r\nweek 17: Stefan\u2013Boltzmann Law\r\nweek 18: Final Exam", "scorePolicy": "Quiz 40% \r\nMidterm exam 30%\r\nFinnal exam 30%", "materials": "\u8ab2\u672c\uff1aFundamentals of heat and mass transfer. 7th ed., 2011, Bergman, Theodore L., and Frank P.
