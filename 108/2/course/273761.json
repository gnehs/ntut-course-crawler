The preliminary knowledge of this course is basic circuit theory. After that, the basic components, which are are about diode, rectifier, BJT, OP Amp., MOSFET, JFET, FET Amp.,will be taught in this course. Finally, we will ask students for conceiving a new project related to the application in electronics.", "schedule": "1\tIntroduction \r\n2\tChap. 1\uff1aIntroduction to Electronics(1)\r\n3\tChap. 1\uff1aIntroduction to Electronics (2)\r\n4\tChap. 2\uff1aOperational Amplifiers (1)\r\n5\tChap. 2\uff1aOperational Amplifiers (2)\r\n6\tChap. 2\uff1aOperational Amplifiers (3)\r\n7\tChap. 3\uff1aDiodes (1)\r\n8\tChap. 3\uff1aDiodes (2)\r\n9\tmidterm (closed book, 2 hours)\r\n10\tChap. 3\uff1aDiodes (3)\r\n11\tChap. 4\uff1aMOS Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET) \r\n12\tChap. 4\uff1aMOS Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET) \r\n13\tChap. 4\uff1aMOS Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET) \r\n14\tChap. 4\uff1aMOS Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFET) \r\n15\tChap. 5\uff1aBipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)\r\n16\tChap. 5\uff1aBipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)\r\n17\tChap. 5\uff1aBipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs)\r\n18\tfinal exam.
