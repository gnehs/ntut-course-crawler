Consequently, these skills will provide the student with a basis to conduct their own such analyzes and to evaluate critically others\u2019 uses of statistics.", "schedule": "Week 1 Introduction to statistics, data Summary, and presentation\r\nWeek 2 Probability, Bayesian theorem, correlation\r\nWeek 3 Random variables and probability distributions \u2013 Random variables, probability\r\nWeek 4 Random variables and probability distributions \u2013 Continuous random variables\r\nWeek 5 Random variables and probability distributions \u2013 Discrete random variables\r\nWeek 6 Decision making for a single sample \u2013 Estimation, hypothesis testing\r\nWeek 7 Decision making for a single sample \u2013 Inference on the mean of a population\r\nWeek 8 Quiz, independent Study\r\nWeek 9 Midterm exam (In-class, 1 Cheat Sheet, Calculator)\r\nWeek 10\tDecision making for a single sample \u2013 Inference on the variance of a normal population\r\nWeek 11\tDecision making for a single sample \u2013 Inference on a population proportion, goodness of fit test\r\nWeek 12\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Inference on the means of two populations (Part I)\r\nWeek 13\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Inference on the means of two populations (Part II)\r\nWeek 14\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Paired t-test, inference on the ratio of variances of two normal populations\r\nWeek 15\tDecision making for two samples \u2013 Inference on two population proportions\r\nWeek 16\tBuilding Empirical Models \u2013 Simple Linear Regression\r\nWeek 17\tQuiz, independent Study\r\nWeek 18\tFinal exam", "scorePolicy": "1.
