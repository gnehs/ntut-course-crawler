Students are expected to research topics, organize a draft, present your ideas, rewrite and edit through extensive reading of famous authors\u2019 works, discussion, and participate in peer review and individual workshops. Throughout the semester, we will continuously practice outlining your essay structure, writing a thesis statement, topic sentences, writing a narrative, description, and offering supporting examples. In addition, you will investigate an issue critically and rhetorically, which means you will inquire deeply into an issue that arises from a particular context, articulate a research question from that inquiry, and develop an informed and complex response to that question. By completing a sequenced writing project, you will learn the skills for academic writing, including ways of reading, investigating, reasoning, questioning, and inventing ideas. We will look at how writing changes when used for different purposes, and how genres of academic writing are shaped for different audiences and contexts. And we will consider how you negotiate languages, discourses, and texts.", "schedule": "Week 1: Introduction\r\nWeek 2: Chapter One: Good Writers are Good Readers\r\nWeek 3: Chapter Two: The Writing Process: planning, generating ideas\r\nWeek 4: Chapter Two: The Writing Process: organizing and drafting.\r\nWeek 5: Chapter Two: The Writing Process\r\nWeek 6: First Essay\r\nWeek 7: Chapter Three: Academic writing.
