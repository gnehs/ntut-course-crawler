Students are expected to research topics, organize a draft, present your ideas, rewrite and edit through extensive reading of famous authors\u2019 works, discussion, and participate in peer review and individual workshops. Throughout the semester, we will continuously practice outlining your essay structure, writing a thesis statement, topic sentences, writing a narrative, description, and offering supporting examples. In addition, you will investigate an issue critically and rhetorically, which means you will inquire deeply into an issue that arises from a particular context, articulate a research question from that inquiry, and develop an informed and complex response to that question. By completing a sequenced writing project, you will learn the capacities for strong academic writing, including ways of reading, investigating, reasoning, questioning, and inventing ideas. We will look at how writing changes when used for different purposes, and how genres of academic writing are shaped for different audiences and contexts. And we will consider how you negotiate languages, discourses, and texts.", "schedule": "Week 1: Introduction\r\nWeek 2: The Power of Image Part one\r\nWeek 3: The Power of Image Part two\r\nWeek 4: The Power of Image part three\r\nWeek 5: Love ad Attraction part one\r\nWeek 6: Love and Attraction Part two \r\nWeek 7: Love and Attraction Part three\r\nWeek 8: Food and Health Part One \r\nWeek 9: Food and Health Part Two  \r\nWeek 10: Food and Health Part Three\r\nWeek 11: Design and Engineering  Part one\r\nWeek 12: Design and Engineering  Part Two \r\nWeek 13: Design and Engineering  Part Three\r\nWeek 14: Human Journey Part One \r\nWeek 15: Human Journey Part Two\r\nWeek 16: Conservation Challenge Part One  \r\nWeek 17: Conservation Challenge Part Two\r\nWeek 18: Presentations/ workshop", "scorePolicy": "Participation / Attendance\t\t\t\t\t  \r\nOne Presentation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nMid-term Exam\t                          \t\t\t     \r\nFinal Paper", "materials": "\u2027\tMacintyre, Paul.
