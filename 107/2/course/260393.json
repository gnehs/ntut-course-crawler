At some points, infrastructure is also often invisible to its users, since most people have rarely considered, if ever, where their energy, water, food, or materials come from.\r\nThis class will therefore seek to rethink the subject of infrastructure from particular perspectives which frame the structure of this module. To explore the richness and extend the discussion of this subject, we proposed a join-class with Taiwan study centre at University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany for more interdisciplinary debates and teaching possibilities as well. There will be two academic discourses-Architecture and sociology involved and formed into five sessions; multiascalar cities, landscape and architecture as infrastructure, social infrastructure in materiality and reproduction, unseen infrastructure and fieldwork in cities. In so doing, it will focus on firstly by reading theory; secondly, by examining specific case studies that illustrates how these theories manifests themselves; and thirdly, by considering how these infrastructures may be changing the understanding of contemporary globalized cities and reproducing urban networks in different fields and countries.", "schedule": "Time Table \r\n1. 02.18-22  Course Introduction  \r\nSession: Urban-spatial Infrastructure  \r\n2. 02.25-03.01  Global Urbanism, Scale, Urban conditions [lecture] \r\n3. 03.04-08  Trans-architecture- dialogue amongst landscape and infrastructure [lecture]\r\n4. 03.11-15  Materiality 01- Brutalism and Socio-technical cities [lecture]\r\n5. 03.18-22  Materiality 02-Mobility, Hpyerlocality, Assemblage [lecture]\r\n\r\nSession: Fieldwork in Cities \r\n6. 03.25-29  05 Essay subject/Fieldwork discussion (Taipei) \r\n7. 04.01-04.
