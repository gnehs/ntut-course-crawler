It also highlights the close relationship between course design and teaching as the teacher builds on knowledge. Students will present and discuss the viewpoints of various classroom teachers and researchers in both ESL and EFL contexts. They, therefore, are expected to finish the assigned readings before class and actively participate in class presentations and discussions.", "schedule": "The course outline will be provided on the first day of class.", "scorePolicy": "Attendance & Participation: 40%\r\nGroup Presentation: 10%\r\nCourse Project: 50%", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
