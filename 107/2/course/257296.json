The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.", "schedule": "1.\tRotation of a rigid body.\r\n2.\tAngular momentum and statics.\r\n3.\tGravitation.\r\n4.\tSolids and fluids.\r\nA.\tDensity.\r\nB.\tPressure.\r\nC.\tContinuity equation.\r\nD.\tBernoulli\u2019s equation.\r\n5.\tOscillations.\r\nA.\tSimple harmonic oscillation.\r\nB.\tEnergy in simple harmonic motion.\r\n6.\tMechanical waves.\r\nA.\tSpeed of a pulse on a string.\r\nB.\tReflection and transmission.\r\nC.\tThe wave equation.\r\n7.\tSound.\r\nA.\tThe nature of a sound wave.\r\nB.\tThe Doppler Effect.\r\n8.\tThermodynamics.\r\nA.\t1st law of thermodynamics.\r\nB.\tEntropy and the 2nd law of thermodynamic.", "scorePolicy": "70% quiz, 30% final exam", "materials": "Benson, H., University Physics, Eurasia, 2013.", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": true}]
