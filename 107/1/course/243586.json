Team work (5 to 6 people) and comprehensive reports (in English, using Microsoft Word 2016 and EndNote X8) are required. Each team will perform literature survey and choose chemical product design problems from state-of-the-art chemical products or products of current industrial interests. Students need to use Aspen Plus to simulate the process, and estimate the production rate, energy cost, etc.", "schedule": "week 1. class introduction\r\nweek 2. basic concepts of process design, Aspen Plus tutorial\r\nweek 3 to 7. Aspen Plus tutorial and practices, literature survey for choosing design problem\r\nweek 8. oral presentation of the selected design problem \r\nweek 9 to 16. working hours for project \r\nweek 17 to 18. oral presentation for the progress", "scorePolicy": "# English \u2013 Except for the 1st class, everyone need to use English for any kind of communication.\r\n# Problem-based learning \u2013 The class is student-centered. Everyone need to come to class on time and participate the class discussions.  \r\n# Grading \u2013 Class participation (+60), oral presentation (+10), written report (+30) \r\n# Networking \u2013 everyone should prepare their NTUT Google account. Everything you have done will be documented in the shared Google Drive folders.", "materials": "1. Ralph Schefflan, Teach Yourself the Basics of Aspen Plus, 2nd\r\n2. Kamal I.M.
