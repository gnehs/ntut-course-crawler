In this course, we will discuss how to apply the computer to assist the molecular structure design. In order to gain insight into the basic concepts of structural design, the fundamental background of chemical bonding will be introduced at the beginning of this course. Then, the geometry of designed molecules will be optimized based on the theory of molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and quantum mechanics. We will emphasize the real practical to get the optimized structures of those designed molecules.\r\n\r\nOutline: \r\n1.\tIntroduction\r\n2.\tIntroduction to chemical bonding of molecules and solids \r\n3.\tIntroduction to Molecular Mechanics\r\n4.\tProperties Analysis\r\n5.\tOptimization Techniques\r\n6.\tMolecular Dynamics", "schedule": "Week 1.\tIntroduction to computational chemistry\r\nWeek 2.\tReview fundamental chemical bonding theory (I)\r\nWeek 3.\tReview fundamental chemical bonding theory (II)\r\nWeek 4.
