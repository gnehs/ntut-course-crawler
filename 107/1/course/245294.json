Students will learn the basic components of computer language through exercises during class time. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this course is to help students feel confident of their ability to map scientific problems into computational framework, design mathematical algorithms, write and debug programs for specific tasks. We will use gfortran compiler to learn Fortran \u2013 the language which has a long relation with scientific computing in Chemical Engineering. \r\n\r\nStudents are welcome, but not required, to bring their own computers to the class. GFortran is a free compiler on major platforms, you can install it on Windows with Cygwin, on Mac with homebrew, and on any distro of Linux.", "schedule": "week 01. class intro, working environment, program, compiler, gnuplot, etc.\r\nweek 02. structure, input and output, declaration, format\r\nweek 03. loop (do) and decision (if)\r\nweek 04. math operators and functions\r\nweek 05. array and files\r\nweek 06. subroutine and module\r\nweek 07. sorting\r\nweek 08.
