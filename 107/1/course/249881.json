These issues are well known by researchers and general public; however, pollutions from construction sites are seldom studied and discussed. Thousand cases of constructions are working monthly, and their potential pollutions can be great impact the environment. The course introduced potential pollution from construction sites and suggested methods to minimize it efficiently.\r\n\r\nCourse Goals \r\nConstruction sites, such as roads and freeways, are important to economic development. During construction, however, such projects pose a significant risk to the environment, which must be addressed out. Compliance with these should minimise the effect of the work on the environment. By the end of the semester, students who complete all necessary assignments will be able to: \r\n1.\tUnderstand major concepts and terminology in the field of construction. \r\n2.\tEvaluate pollution from construction sites and control them.", "schedule": "1\t09/11-13      Class syllabus, grading system, text book and references\r\n2      09/18-20      Pollution & disaster\r\n3\t09/25-27      Pollution prevention planning\r\n4      10/02-04\t    Noise & vibration\r\n5\t10/09-11      Air pollution (1/2)\r\n6\t10/16-18      Air pollution (2/2) \r\n7\t10/23-25      Water pollution\r\n8\t10/30\t     Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (1/2)\r\n9\t11/06  \t     Mid-term exam\r\n10\t11/13-15       Soil pollution & land subsidence\r\n11\t11/20-22       Waste & contaminated materials\r\n12\t11/27-29       Landscape destruction\r\n13\t12/04-06       Inspections, monitoring & audits\r\n14\t12/11-13       Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (2/2)\r\n15\t12/18-20       Construction automation\r\n16\t12/25-27       Sustainable construction\r\n17\t01/03-10       Students\u2019 group reports\r\n18    01/08\t     Final exam", "scorePolicy": "1.
