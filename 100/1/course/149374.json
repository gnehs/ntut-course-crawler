Written translation involves not only the transferring of words between two languages but also the construction of a text, a culture and an identity, the result of which exerts significant influences on the target society.  In this semester, we will discuss the technical issues specific to lexical, syntactical and semantic differences in translating English into Chinese, and examine various cultural issues involved in the act of translation.  Students will be asked to undertake 3 translation projects, and in pair work, comments on each other\u2019s translated texts.", "schedule": "week\tDate\tTopic\n1\t9/14\tIntroduction\n2\t9/21\t\u82f1\u6f22\u8a5e\u5f59\u8207\u53e5\u6cd5\u7684\u5c0d\u6bd4\n3\t9/28\t\u8fad\u610f\u7684\u9078\u64c7,\u5f15\u7533\u548c\u8912\u8cb6\n4\t10/5\t\u8a5e\u985e\u8f49\u8b6f\n5\t10/12\t\u589e\u8a5e\u6cd5 \n6\t10/19\t\u91cd\u8907\u6cd5\n7\t10/26\t\u7701\u7565\u6cd5\n8\t11/2\t\u6b63\u53cd\u8868\u9054\u6cd5\n9\t11/9\t\u5206\u53e5\u3001\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\n10\t11/16\t\u88ab\u52d5\u8a9e\u614b\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n11\t11/23\t\u540d\u8a5e\u5b50\u53e5\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n12\t11/30\t\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e\u5b50\u53e5\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n13\t12/7\t\u526f\u8a5e\u5b50\u53e5\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n14\t12/14\t\u9577\u53e5\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n15\t12/21\t\u7fd2\u6163\u8a9e\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n16\t12/28\t\u5916\u4f86\u8a9e\u7684\u8b6f\u6cd5\n17\t1/4\t\u8aa4\u8b6f\u5206\u6790\n18\t1/11\tReview and Discussion", "scorePolicy": "Grading:\n1.

Delayed submission will NOT be accepted on any account.\n2.\tThere will be in-class translation practices and review tests to help you better grasp the essentials of each unit.  You have to submit your written practices or tests before the end of the class.  There is no way to make up for the translation practice or review test you miss.  No exceptions!  However, your lowest score will be dropped\u2014so, save this for the unexpected occasion when you might be sick or miss class for other reason.\n3.  Any errors in your work resulting from an unwillingness to look something up in a dictionary or grammar reference will have a negative impact on your translation grade. \n3.\tYour regular attendance is required to pass this class.  3 unexcused absences from class will result in failing this course.  Excused absences require that I be notified on or before the class date, or with official documentation shortly after the absence.  One unexcused absence will result in an automatic final score reduction of 3 points.  If you are more than 15 minutes late to the class, it will be counted as an absence.  One late attendance means a 1 point reduction from your final score.", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
