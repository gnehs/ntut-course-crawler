Throughout the course, students will learn to develop their writing through dialogic interactions with texts, through class discussion and other collaborative class practices, and through sequenced assignments.  \nIn addition to the essays which aim to demonstrate essential writing skills, Jodi Picoult\u2019s My Sister\u2019s Keeper is especially selected for Project II. Students are required to compile a reading portfolio to demonstrate their progress as a close reader and reflective writer. It is hoped that through such an approach, students\u2019 vocabulary power will be enriched, their ability in literary analysis cultivated, and their writing skill advanced.", "schedule": "9/13\tWriter\u2019s Block-----\u201cMisconceptions about Writing\u201d\n9/20\tFinding the Topic Sentence----\u201cGary Larson\u2019s Cartoon\u201d\t\t\n9/27\tActive Reading; Observing----\u201cJimson Weed\u201d\n10/4\tFree Association----\u201cMy First Wrestling\u201d\t\t\n         1st draft of Project I\n10/11\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\n10/18\tFinding the Central Idea----\u201cThe Match\u201d\t\n         2nd draft of Project I\n10/25\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher  \n11/1\tNTUT 100th Anniversary\n11/8\tHow to Write a Summary ----\u201cDaddy Tucked the Blanket\u201d\n         Project I completed\n11/15   \u201cOur Barbies, Ourselves\u201d\t\n11/22\tHow to Write a Paraphrase----\u201cAn Anthropologist on Mars\u201d 12/6     Paraphrasing Poems by Robert Frost\t\n12/13\tCharacter Analysis\t----\u201cStory of an Hour\u201d\t\n         1st Draft of Project II\n12/20\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\n12/27\tAnalysis Paper----\u201cStory of an Hour\u201d\t\n         2nd Draft of Project II\n1/3\tOne-to-one discussion with the teacher\n1/10\tReview and Discussion\tProject II completed", "scorePolicy": "Criteria for Grading\n1.Project I :35% :(1st draft: 10%;  2nd draft: 10%; 3rd draft: 15%)\n2.Project II: 35%(1st draft: 10%;  2nd draft: 10%; 3rd draft: 15%)\n3.

One unexcused absence will result in an automatic final score reduction of 3 points.  If you are more than 20 minutes late to the class, it will be counted as an absence.  One late attendance means a 1 point reduction from your final score. \n2.  Throughout the semester, there will be in-class activities (peer-reviewing, group discussion) and in-class writings (free-writing, response to the selected reading text, peer comments, pair-writing).  If you fail to submit the exercise by the end of the class, there is no way to make it up (no exceptions).
