The course provides a comprehensive treatment of the major aspects of using statistical methodology for quality control and improvement.  Both traditional and modern methods are introduced, including state-of-the-art techniques for statistical process monitoring and control and statistically designed experiments for process characterization, optimization, and process robustness studies. Students will: 1) learn to apply control charts to monitor the quality characteristics of a product or process; 2) learn techniques for assessing how capable a process is of achieving given design specification, and 3) design and analyze experiments for improving a manufacturing process; 4) realize how the modern quality management system works under competing environments.", "schedule": "1\tIntroduction & Modern Business Environment\tChapter 1\n2\tStatistical Methods Useful in QC & Improvement\tChapter 2.1-2.4\n3\tInferences about Process Quality\tChapter 3.1-3.3\n4\tInferences about Process Quality \tChapter 3.4-3.5\n5\tPhilosophy of Statistical Process Control\tChapter 4.1-4.3\n6\tPhilosophy of Statistical Process Control\tChapter 4.4-4.7\n7\tControl Charts for Variables \tChapter 5.1-5.3\n8\tControl Charts for Variables \tChapter 5.4-5.6\n9\tMidterm Exam\tin class\n10\tReview of Midterm Exam\t\n11\tControl Charts for Attributes \tChapter 6.1-6.3\n12\tControl Charts for Attributes \tChapter 6.4-6.5\n13\tProcess & Measurement System\tChapter 7.1-7.4\n14\tProcess and Measurement System \tChapter 7.5-7.8\n15\tCUSUM & EWMA Control Charts \tChapter 8.1-8.2\n16\tOther Univariate Monitoring Techniques \tChapter 9.1-9.4\n17\tFinal Exam\tin class", "scorePolicy": "Grading Policy: 25% Homework Assignments & Quizzes, 30% Midterm, 30% Final, 15% Group Term Project", "materials": "[Textbook]\n\nDouglas C.
