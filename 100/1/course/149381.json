What are its origins and functions within Western culture?  We will identify genres within the theatre and study the formal choices characteristic of each genre and within every historical period.  We will study the fundamental characteristics of dramatic form including plot, character, action, and setting, as well as the conventions of dramatic genres, specifically tragedy, comedy, and tragicomedy.  We will then turn our attention to the basic repertoire of the actor, the combinations of voice, movement, characterization and emotional shading which help enact the playwright\u2019s vision.  As an adjunct to this, we will look at the basics of theatre: blocking, costuming, make-up, set design and tips on memorization and the efficient use of rehearsal time.  Our major undertaking will be the production of one full-length of several shorter plays by a well-respected playwright.  Each student will be responsible for bringing about the enactment of drama chosen by the class under my guidance.  The course may be a bit of a challenge, but it is a great opportunity for you to create living art of masterpiece quality and to discover the difference between writing done purely as a mode of elementary communication, or for mere entertainment, and writing that is open-ended, provocative, dynamic, haunting, and relentless in its dis/solving of the puzzle of the Real.", "schedule": "September 14\tINTRODUCTION: Theatrical period, style, genre.
