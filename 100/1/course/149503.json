It counts 20% of the final grade for graduate students.\n2.Suggested topics: 3D video (multi-view video coding, depth estimation, view synthesis), H.264 scalable video coding, HEVC (high-efficiency video coding), H.264/MPEG-2 transcoding, H.264 error resilience and error concealment, wavelet-based image or video processing, and other emerging VSP techniques.\n3.You need to implement a VSP algorithm by yourself in C, C++, Java, or MATLAB. Programs readily available can only be used as references or a part of your code. You must clearly identify your efforts and contribution.\nGrading:\n1.Proposal, 10%\n2.Functionality and contribution, 50%\n3.Oral presentation, 20%\n4.Written report with simulation results and codes, 20%\nTentative Schedule:\nDec. 13 (Mon.):\n-A 1-2 page written proposal with the topic, motivation, problem formulation, goal, and references.\n-To determine the presentation order.\nJan. 4/5/11/12:\n-Oral presentation with demonstration.\n-15-20 minutes for each person.\nJan. 16 (Mon.): Make-up demonstrations\nJan. 17 (Tue.): Written report due (12:00 noon)", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
