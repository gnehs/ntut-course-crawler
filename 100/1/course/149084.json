Topics covered will include the probability axioms, basic combinatorics, discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions, mathematical expectation, common families of probability distributions, the central limit theorem, inferential statistics, and some useful statistical methods. The course objectives are to enable students having the ability to\n\u25a1\tSummarize and present data; \n\u25a1\tDescribe probability distributions and compute probabilities; \n\u25a1\tConduct point and interval estimation; \n\u25a1\tMake inference about populations; \n\u25a1\tApply these concepts in practice with emphasis on engineering applications, engineering design, decision making and management sciences.", "schedule": "1\tIntroduction to Probability\tChapter 1.1-1.2\n2\tIntroduction to Probability \tChapter 1.3-1.6\n3\tDiscrete Distributions\tChapter 2.1-2.2 \n4\tDiscrete Distributions\tChapter 2.3-2.4\n5\tDiscrete Distributions \tChapter 2.5-2.6\n6\tContinuous Distributions\tChapter 3.1-3.2\n7\tContinuous Distributions \tChapter 3.3-3.5\n8\tContinuous Distributions & Recapitulation \tChapter 3.6-3.7\n9\tMidterm Exam\tin class\n10\tReview of Midterm Exam\t\n11\tBivariate Distributions \tChapter 4.1-4.2\n12\tBivariate Distributions\tChapter 4.3-4.4\n13\tDistributions of Functions of Random Variables\tChapter 5.1-5.2\n14\tDistributions of Functions of Random Variables\tChapter 5.3-5.4\n15\tDistributions of Functions of Random Variables\tChapter 5.5-5.7\n16\tRecapitulation & Homework Assignments Review\t\n17\tFinal Exam\tin class", "scorePolicy": "Grading Policy: 30% Homework Assignments & Quizzes, 30% Midterm, 30% Final, 10% Participation", "materials": "[Textbook]\n\nRobert V.
