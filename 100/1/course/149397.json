What is the purpose of popular culture? Who decides what popular culture is, and who decides what high culture is? We will pay particular attention to the ways in which popular culture becomes high culture and vice versa. We will analyze how similar stories recur across various time periods and geographic regions, how modernity affects our view of culture and art, and how stories changed when told in different genres. Students will make two group presentations, one related to course topics and one about an area of popular culture that particularly interests you. Students will participate in in-class writing and quizzes, write two formal reflection papers, and take one exam.", "schedule": "Week 1 Sept 15\nWhat is Pop Culture?\nfrom Chaucer\u2019s House of Fame\nfrom Beowulf\nfrom Anglo-Saxon Riddles\nfrom T.
