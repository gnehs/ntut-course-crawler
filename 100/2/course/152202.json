Applied linguistics addresses the need to understand how the role of language is played in many aspects of human activities in order to inform language-related policy making.\r\nCourse Objectives:  This course aims to help the students\r\n(1) to understand the principles governing applied linguistics studies\r\n(2) to examine studies and theories in major applied linguistics issues\r\n(3) to encourage students to engage in more applied linguistics studies\r\nCourse Requirements:\r\n(1)\tAll students are required to use a copyrighted textbook. No photocopied edition will be accepted for use in class. It is important for students to be aware that legal action will potentially be sought by the publisher in the case of using an unauthorized duplicated text.\r\n(2)\tSubmit a summary of the chapter section assigned to students and give a brief presentation. (sample provided) Students are divided into four groups. Each group will be responsible for providing a pr\u00e9cis of one chapter assigned respectively. Each summary needs to be submitted to the instructor and distributed to the class prior to / on the date when the content chapter content is scheduled to be introduced.\r\n(3)\tQuizzes (2-3), midterm and final exams will be implemented. Students must follow all instructed testing requirements.\r\n(4)\tEach student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.\r\n(5)\tAdditional readings will be assigned if necessary. As applied linguistics is multi-disciplinary in nature and comprises a broad array of theories and studies, students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings. In order to earn extra credits, students are obligated to submit a short critique of the recommended reading text.\r\n(6)\tAttendance: Students are required to attend the class as scheduled.\r\ni.\tEach unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction.\r\nii.\tAt the sole discretion of the instructor, some absence penalties may be waived with valid proof and just cause. No Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. Students forfeit the right of contention after that. It is important to know that only ONE- time penalty waiver will be granted to any student.\r\niii.\tLateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Two times of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.", "schedule": "Weekly Syllabus \r\nWeek \tText Chapter \r\n1\tOrientation / Applying Linguistics: disciplines, theories, models and descriptions (McCarthy)\r\n2\tApplying Linguistics: disciplines, theories, models and descriptions (McCarthy)\r\n3\tGrammar_1 (Schmitt) \r\n4\tGrammar_2 (Schmitt) / Vocabulary_1 (Schmitt)\r\n5\tVocabulary_2 (Schmitt) / Discourse Analysis_1 (Schmitt)\r\n6\tDiscourse Analysis_2 (Schmitt) \r\n7\tNo Class (University Day-Off)\r\n8\tReview \r\n9\tMidterm \r\n10\tPragmatics_ 1 (Schmitt)\r\n11\tPragmatics_2 (Schmitt)\r\n12\tSecond Language Acquisition (Schmitt) \r\n13\tPsycholinguistics (Schmitt) \r\n14\tSociolinguistics (Schmitt) \r\n15\tWorld Englishes: Learning English in a global context (Houston & Oakey) \r\n16\tThe Translator\u2019s Choice (Houston & Oakey)\r\n17\tReview \r\n18\tFinal Exam \r\n*Class schedule is subject to necessary modifications at the professor\u2019s discretion.", "scorePolicy": "Evaluation Procedures & Grading System:\r\nFinal grades will be determined by a point system (X out of 100 total points).
