First of all, it offers an unique opportunity to obtain comprehensive understanding about modern geoinformatics. In this course, students will be able to gain insights into the state-of-the-art research, development, and applications in geoinformatics, especially the 3S technologies (RS, GIS, GPS) and their integrations for sophisticated applications such as cyber city implementation and applications. For engineering students, this course is also an effective platform for capacity-building and career extending. The main topics of this course include:\r\n1. Introduction-Geoinformatics at a glance\r\n2. Remote Sensing (RS) .Remote Sensing Fundamentals; Airborne Remote Sensing ; Satellite Remote Sensing\r\n3. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\r\n4. Global Positioning System (GPS) and navigation\r\n5.Cyber City Implementation and Applications", "schedule": "Week 1: Introduction to Geoinformatics\r\nWeek 2-3: Fundamentals of remote sensing\r\nWeek 4-6: Airborne and satellite remote sensing\r\nWeek 7: 1st mid-term exam.\r\nWeek 8-10: GIS fundamentals and applications\r\nWeek 11-12: Global Positioning and Navigation\r\nWeek 13: 2nd mid-term exam.\r\nWeek 14-15: Cyber city implementation\r\nWeek 16-17: Cyber city applications\r\nWeek 18: Final Exam.", "scorePolicy": "1st mid-term: 20%\r\n2nd mid-term: 20%\r\nFinal exam: 30%\r\nQuizzes and homework: 40%\r\nClass participation and performance: 10%", "materials": "1.
