For, at the westernmost coast of the Western world is that land of dreams and illusions, California.  The poems and stories we will be reading, the films we will be viewing and the music we will be listening to all bear on California.  Since California was originally part of a much vaster territory belonging to Mexico we will feel free to widen our scope to that portion of the West which was last settled by European immigrants.  We will consider California\u2019s multiple origins and its many ethnicities\u2014white, black, Chinese, Hispanic and Native American.  We will find in Hollywood the font of America\u2019s mythology.  The cowboy, the private-eye, the movie star, all emerge in their most vivid renderings from the made-up world of the motion-picture studios.  In San Francisco, further north, other sorts of dreams, utopian, mystical, find their furthest development.  Here was the center of the beatnik movement of the 1950\u2019s and the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960\u2019s, each with its own music, poetry and tales to tell.  In Mexico to this day one finds a curious blend of Spanish (with its own curious combination of European and Moorish roots), and aboriginal customs and beliefs, and we will also examine these, linking ancient mythologies with the most modern the West has to offer:  the California Dream.", "schedule": "February 22\tIntroduction:  Woody Guthrie\u2019s dust bowl ballads and John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath.

Students must keep a journal on an ongoing basis containing responses to the works they are examining and share these writings with the rest of the class.  To receive full credit, you must bring your journal entry to class and read it aloud on the day that it is due.  I will not accept late or e-mailed journal entries or writing assignments.\r\n\r\n2) Presentations.  Students will give an oral presentation in concert with two or three classmates.  Preparation of these presentations will lead to development and refinement of your understanding of literature, and will provide a meaningful context for discussion in the class.\r\n\r\n3)  Attendance.  Frequent attendance is mandatory.  After your first two absences, each subsequent unexcused absence will cause your final grade to be reduced by one grade point.  If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out the substance of class discussions and to make up homework.  \r\n\r\n4)  Anyone caught plagiarizing will receive a failing grade in the course.  All outside sources that you use in the production of your papers must be properly attributed using the MLA format.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADING\r\n\r\n25%\tMidterm Exam\t\t\t\t\r\n25%\tParticipation\r\n25%\tHomework Assignments\t\t\t\r\n25%\tFinal Exam", "materials": "\u3000", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
