The course will be a study in reality, illusion, fantasy, stereotype, desire, deconstruction, globalism, deconstruction, and ideology, among other topics.", "schedule": "Wk 1: Introduction\r\n\r\nWk 2: 300 [2007]\r\nWk 3: Lecture on 300: Ideology\r\n\r\nWk 4: Black Narcissus [1947]\r\nWk 5: Lecture on Black Narcissus: Desire\r\n\r\nWk 6: Keys to the Kingdom [1944]\r\nWk 7: Lecture on Keys to the Kingdom: Religion, Stereotype, Cliche\r\n\r\nWk 8: MID-TERM 40%\r\n\r\nWk 9: M Butterfly [1993]\r\nWk 10: Lecture on M Butterfly: Deconstruction\r\n\r\nWk 11: Memoirs of a Geisha [2005]\r\nWk 12: Lecture on Memoirs of a Geisha: \u201cWoman does not exist\u201d\r\n\r\nWk 13: L\u2019Amant [The Lover] [1992]\r\nWk 14: Lecture on L\u2019Amant: Cross Cultural Love, Feminism, and Destruction\r\n\r\nWk 15: The Fly [1986]\r\nWk 16: Lecture on The Fly: Globalism\r\n\r\nWk 17: Reading \u201cChina\u201d from Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of History; Excerpts from Barthes\u2019s Empire of Signs\r\n \r\nWk 18: FINAL EXAM 60%", "scorePolicy": "Text: Photocopied lectures.\r\nEvaluation: Mid-Term Exam 40 %.
