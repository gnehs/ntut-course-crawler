Then, the modern quantum chemistry will be introduced to make students familiarized the modern chemistry approach on the interpretation of the physical chemistry phenomena in material and biological science. This includes the introduction to quantum world, Schrodinger equation, chemical bonding, molecular shape and structure and so on. Later, the thermodynamics be applied to the interpretation of  physical and chemical equilibrium, acids and bases, aqueous equilibrium and electrochemistry.", "schedule": "week 1 The shape of molecules\r\nweek 2  Theory of Covalent Bonding(I)\r\nweek 3  Theory of Covalent Bonding(II)\r\nweek 4  Organic Compounds and the Atomic Properties of Carbon (I)\r\nweek 5  Organic Compounds and the Atomic Properties of Carbon (II)\r\nweek 6  The Transition Elements and Their Coordination Compounds (I)\r\nweek 7  The Transition Elements and Their Coordination Compounds (II)\r\nweek 8  Special Selected Topic (I)\r\nweek 9  Midterm\r\nweek 10 Intermolecular Forces: Liquids, Solids, and Phase Changes\r\nweek 11 The properties of Mixtures: Solutions and Colloids\r\nweek 12 Rates and Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions(I)\r\nweek 13 Rates and Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions(II)\r\nweek 14 Thermodynamics : Entropy, Free Energy, and the Direction of Chemical Reactions (I)\r\nweek 15 Thermodynamics : Entropy, Free Energy, and the Direction of Chemical Reactions (II)\r\nweek 16 Electrochemistry : Chemical Change and Electrical Work\r\nweek 17 Special Selected Topic (II)\r\nweek 18 Final Exam.", "scorePolicy": "(1) \u671f\u4e2d\u8003 : 40%\r\n(2) \u671f\u672b\u8003:  40%\r\n(3) \u5e73\u6642\u6210\u7e3e: 20%", "materials": "Textbook : Martin S.
