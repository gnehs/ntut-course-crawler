The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.", "schedule": "1.\tIntroduction.\r\n8.\tConservation of Mechanical Energy\r\n9.\tLinear Momentum\r\n10.\tSystem of Particles\r\n11.\tRotation of a Rigid Body\r\n12.\tAngular Momentum and Statics\r\n13.\tGravitation", "scorePolicy": "Homework/Quizzes: 20% (\u9072\u4ea4/\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nMidterm\t\t: 30% (\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nFinal Exam    \t: 30% (\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nAttendance   \t: 10% \r\nParticipation\t:  10%\uff08\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b, \u4e0a\u8ab2\u8868\u73fe\uff09", "materials": "Harris Benson (2013).
