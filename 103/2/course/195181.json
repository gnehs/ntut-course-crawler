The use of any form of recording device and/or photographing is strictly prohibited. \r\n(2)\tStudents are divided into 8-10 groups to give brief in-class presentations as well as provide lecture notes and summary. \r\ni.\tAll PPT presentations need to comply with the format as instructed and modeled by the instructor.\r\nii.\tDetailed notes of presentation handouts for distribution in class need to incorporate all theories, arguments, discussions and studies reviewed in the textbook. English-Chinese bilingual handouts are preferred. \r\niii.\tComprehensive and detailed notes of lectures are required for study review. \r\niv.\tA full-length, revised PPT content, lecture notes, and the Chinese translation of the text are due for submission a week after the presentation session. All the aforementioned materials need to be distributed to all students enrolled. \r\n(3)\tEach student will be given abundant opportunities to provide his/ her response toward the assigned reading content as the lectures proceed. Students must complete all readings assigned prior to the class session.  \r\n(4)\tThe instructor will not assign additional readings. However, as SLA is multi-disciplinary in nature, it comprises a broad array of theories and studies. Students who are highly interested in this field are strongly encouraged to consult the professor for further suggested readings.\r\n(5)\tAttendance: Students are required to attend class as scheduled. \r\ni.\tEach unexcused absence will result in 10% semester grade deduction. \r\nii.\tAt the sole discretion of the instructor, absence penalty may be waived with valid proof and just cause. Penalty waiver request will only be accepted in two weeks of the date of absence. It is important to know that generally only ONE- time penalty waiver will be considered.  \r\niii.\tLateness to class: Any arrival to class after the instructor finishes the second-round roll call is considered lateness. Each occasions of lateness will, in effect, incur a grade penalty of 5% semester grade deduction.\r\nEvaluation Procedures & Grading System:\r\n\tFinal grades will be determined by a point system (X out of 100 total points). Students will be evaluated by their presentations, handouts, full-length text translations, in-class exams, and attendance. Please be advised that individual class notes, covering all lecture sessions, shall be respectively submitted in the week prior to the midterm and final exam. The failure will result in a 20% grade deduction of the exam.\r\n(1)\tPPT Presentation & Translation / Handouts / Notes 20%\r\n(2)\tIndividual lecture notes 10% \r\n(3)\tExams (Midterm & Final) 40% \r\n(4)\tAttendance 30%", "materials": "Required Texts:  Selected Chapters from Understanding Second Language Acquisition (Ellis) / Second Language Acquisition (Ellis) / How Languages are Learned (Lightbown & Spada)", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
