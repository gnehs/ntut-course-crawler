My course will also discuss\r\nmodern Western literature, but with the caveat that modern has multiple meanings, including post-medieval, Modernist, and up-to-date. My course focuses on the first two meanings, and readings will be taken from the 19th and 20th century, allowing students to read widely and see profound shifts in style and purpose. We will read novels (and excerpts of novels), poetry, and drama. I am excited to be discussing the works of British, Russian, Romanian, French, and American authors.", "foreignLanguageTextbooks": false}]
