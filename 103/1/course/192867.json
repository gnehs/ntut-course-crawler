The course objectives include: 1.) A calculus based survey course of basic physics principles. 2.) Resolve a system of forces as they relate to the dynamics of motion. 3.) Explain Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion and apply them in the analyses of problems. 4.) Apply the principles of motion and conduct controlled experiments. 5.) Solve problems and demonstrate the application of the scientific method.", "schedule": "1.\tIntroduction.\r\n2.\tVector.\r\n       A.\tCoordinate systems.\r\n       B.\tVector and scalar quantities.\r\n3.\tMotion in one dimension.\r\n       A.\tPosition, velocity, and speed.\r\n       B.\tAcceleration - Derivatives.\r\n       C.\tFreely falling objectives.\r\n       D.\tThe Momentum equation.\r\n4.\tMotion in two dimensions.\r\n       A.\tTwo dimensional motion with constant acceleration.\r\n       B.\tProjectile motion.\r\n       C.\tUniform circular motion.\r\n       D.\tTangential and radial acceleration.\r\n5.\tThe laws of motion.\r\n       A.\tThe concept of force.\r\n       B.\tNewton\u2019s first law.\r\n       C.\tMass.\r\n       D.\tNewton\u2019s second law.\r\n       E.\tThe gravitational force and weight.\r\n       F.\tNewton\u2019s third law.\r\n       G.\tSome applications of Newton\u2019s Laws.\r\n6.\tCircular motion and other applications of Newton\u2019s Laws.\r\n       A.\tForces of friction\r\n       B.\tUniform circular motion\r\n7.\tEnergy of a system.\r\n       A.\tWork done by a constant force.\r\n       B.\tKinetic energy and the work-kinetic energy theorem.\r\n       C.\tThe potential energy.\r\n       D.\tConservation of energy.", "scorePolicy": "Homework/Quizzes: 20% (\u9072\u4ea4/\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nMidterm\t\t: 30% (\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nFinal Exam    \t: 30% (\u7f3a\u5e2d\u8005\u4ee5\u96f6\u5206\u8a08\u7b97)\r\nAttendance   \t: 10% (\u7f3a\u5e2d\u4e00\u6b21\u62632\uff05, \u9072\u523015\u5206\u9418\u7576\u7f3a\u5e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u7db2\u8def\u8a18\u9304\u70ba\u6e96)\r\nParticipation\t:  10%\uff08\u5b78\u7fd2\u72c0\u614b\uff1a\u4e0a\u8ab2\u8868\u73fe\u3001\u5b78\u671f\u9593\u81f3\u5c11\u524d\u898b\u6211\u4e8c\u6b21\uff09", "materials": "Harris Benson (2013).
