It has developed rapidly over the past decade. The reason for the recent advances in structural geology has been the realization that naturally deformed rocks seen in field outcrops contain a fantastic range of small-scale features which relate directly to large-scale orogenic deformation systems. The other reason has been the realization that rock deformation, like any other form of deformation, obeys well-defined physical and chemical laws. Base on this situation, this course is intended to serve as an accompaniment to techniques-based courses in structural geology or as an accompaniment to the laboratory portion of a postgraduate course. Systematic study of this advanced structural geology course includes several topics: mechanic properties and deformation behaviors of rocks, strain analysis, ductile geologic structures, brittle geologic structures, and applied structural geology.", "schedule": "\u3000", "scorePolicy": "\u3000", "materials": "1.Davis, G.
